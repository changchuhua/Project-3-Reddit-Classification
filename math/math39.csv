So, i was reading about ""Separable preferences"" in voting domains. A little background on setting:

Let's consider we have *n* (binary) issues and some voters who vote for either 0 or 1 (since binary issues) for each issue. We shall consider the combinatorial domain of preferences on all issues instead of one issue at a time (i.e., alternatives = D1 X D2 X D3, where D1 is domain of issue 1). 

&amp;#x200B;

A ranking order is *called as separable preference* if the preference of a voter for an issue (i) is same for every combination of alternatives of other (-i) issues. An example is,

111 &gt; 011 &gt; 101 &gt; 001 &gt; 110 &gt; 010 &gt; 100 &gt; 000

Here, voter prefers alternative 1 to 0 for every issue (i) irrespective of the combinations of other issues {1,2,3}\\{i} i.e., 

**1**11&gt; **0**11,    **1**01&gt; **0**01,     0**1**1&gt; 0**0**1,     10**1**\&gt; 10**0** etc

Informally, if a voter has separable preferences, he would just report the same top alternative that he has in combined domain when the issues are treated separately (single domain) i.e., if 110 is top alternative, he would report 1 for issue 1, 1 for issue 2 and 0 for issue 3.

Now surely this order is not unique. So, i was just interested in finding how many such orderings are possible with the restriction of ""Separable Preferences"".

&amp;#x200B;

I worked on it and found that for every preferred (or top) alternative (eg: 111, there are 8 such), we have 48 such possible combinations which are separable. Here's my work:

&amp;#x200B;

Solving for 111 as top alternative,

Obviously 111 should be placed at first position and 000 at the end of ranking. We need to fill the remaining 6 positions. If we observe clearly, we have 2 types of numbers (or alternatives) among the remaining 6. Which are type 1 (110, 101, 011) and type 2 (100, 010, 001). Clearly, each alternative from type 1 (eg: 110) is preferred to two alternatives in type 2 (010, 100) and is not comparable to the remaining alternative in type 2 bundle (001). And we can't compare any two alternatives of same type. So, their respective ordering shouldn't matter. So, we can solve this in two steps

&amp;#x200B;

* 111&gt; (type 1) &gt; (type 2) &gt; 000

Since nothing in type 2 is more preferred to type 1 bundle, this ordering is separable and there are 3! \* 3! combinations of this type, hence 36 combinations

* 111&gt; (**any two from type 1**)&gt; (that single alternative from type 2 which is not comparable to the remaining alternative from type 1, obviously, this specific alternative turns out to be opposite (or negation?) of the remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (*remaining alternatives from type 2*)&gt; 000

eg: 111&gt; (110, 101)&gt; (100)&gt; (011)&gt; (010, 001)&gt; 000

There are (**3c2\*2!**)\* 1\* 1\* (*2!*) = 12

&amp;#x200B;

Hence, 36+12=48 combinations. This can be solved because of less number of issues and alternatives. But, how to extend this to a general setting (n issues, a alternatives)? Any help is appreciated also feel free to point out if i committed any mistake above. Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!

&lt;p&gt;x^3+6x^2+8x-9177=0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x[(x+4)(x+2)]-9177=0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here i got stuck. help.&lt;/p&gt;

For the work I usually do, I usually just invoice the amount I'm charging and ask clients to pay in to my bank account. I have a client who for various reasons has to use a credit card to pay contractors and they suggested I setup a paypal account for this purpose so they can pay me that way.

This works fine, but paypal charges a 2.6% payment processing fee. I pass this on to the client, but I didn't realise that there's actually a flaw in how I've been doing this.

My total fee for the job was $2850. I added a 2.6% surcharge for Paypal's processing fees, and invoiced my client for $2924.1, (2850 * 1.026). This all seemed fine, but then when I received my payment, and Paypal deducted their fee I found myself left with $2847.77, not $2850. I tried to work out why I was shorted $2.23 and realised it was because the $76.33 that paypal had charged me was 2.6% of $2924.1 not, $2850 which makes sense of course, because that's how much the client paid me as per my invoice. So I realised it wasn't as simple as just charging the Amount*1.026 to get the total plus processing fees incorporated.

Again, I'm in general pretty embarrassed about my lack of mathematical ability so I found myself having to look this up on Google for an answer, not knowing how I'd calculate it myself. I found a solution, and I tested it with my latest invoice and sure enough it leaves me with exactly $2850 as it should do, except the problem is I don't understand *HOW* it works. I don't think I should just blindly use a formula I don't understand, especially not as the amount I'll be charging will differ from Amount*1.026 which to me seemed the intuitive way to calculate, so I may find myself having to explain why the amount invoiced, is what it is, and I currently wouldn't be able to.

The formula I found was

A / (100 - fee percentage)  * 100

So in my case

2850 / (100-2.6) * 100 =2926.0780287

If I were to take random numbers such as 13, 14, 15, and multiply them by base 3, I would get 39, 42, and 45—reducing these integers by adding the digits to each other gets me 3, 6, and 9...

3 + 9 = 1 + 2 = 3

4 + 2 = 6

4 + 5 = 9


Adding the next consecutive numbers 46, 47, and 48 would get me another cycle of 3, 6, and 9.

Multiplying any number by a base 6 would get me consecutive combinations of 9, 6, 3...

Does anyone know what this is called or what math properties this touches on???

I’ve been up at nights thinking about this and I don’t know what it is lol.

Thanks for anyone’s help in advance!!!

I'm not sure what the multiplication rule is, I know in a group its just an operation for any two elements of the group. so is the multiplication rule the same for fundamental groups?

   * I'm not sure about this. I learned in what groups are, which is a set with an operation that can be applied to every element in the set, and in groups they are only communitative if they are albeian, and it works for every element in the group. I'm not sure if this property works for fundamental groups, or it would only work if it is albein right? So I'm thinking False, unless it the group is albeian?  

* True of false: if X is a subset of Y then π1(X,b) is a subgroup of π1(Y,b).
   * I think this is true? I know that for Z is a sub
* True or false: if X is a subset of **R**2 then π1(X,b) is the trivial group.
   * I think this is false.. I thought the trivial group is just like the constant function? so since X is a subset of R2 doesn't necesarially mean X is R1, in which case it would be the trivial group.

I learned in what groups are, which is a set with an operation that can be applied to every element in the set, and in groups they are only communitative if they are albeian, and it works for every element in the group. I&amp;#39;m not sure if this property works for fundamental groups, or it would only work if it is albein right? So I&amp;#39;m thinking False, unless it the group is albeian?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;True of false: if X is a subset of Y then π1(X,b) is a subgroup of π1(Y,b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this is true? I know that for Z is a sub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;True or false: if X is a subset of &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;2 then π1(X,b) is the trivial group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this is false.. I thought the trivial group is just like the constant function? so since X is a subset of R2 doesn&amp;#39;t necesarially mean X is R1, in which case it would be the trivial group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These last two I don&amp;#39;t get how to solve at all.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove that if a is a path and c is the constant path at a(1) then ac ~ a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prove that if ab ~ a then b ~ c, where c is a constant path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Lets say g(x) = x^(2)

Lets say f(x) = x^(3/2)

Therefore f(g(x)) = (x^(2))^(3/2)= x^(3) (because the 2's cancel out)

If h(x) = x^(3), then h(x) is not even

*h(x) = f(g(x))*

The system of battle is: Random number generate from the stat eg. Speed stat 7 randomly generate a number from 1 to 7


Here's how a battle plays out. 1 v 1. You generate a speed stat and so does your opponent. Whoever has the higher number goes first. Whoever had the highest attacks by generating from their attack stat. You have a choice to block which means generate from your defense stat. If you generate a higher number then the attack no health is taken away. If you generate lower than the attack its attack number - defense number then that's taken away from your Health. You also have the choice to try to evade the attack. You generate from speed. Then your opponent generates from attack precision. If attack precision is higher then speed the attack number is taken from your health. If speed is higher then no damage is taken. This continues until someone drops to 0 health 

If two people generate the same number on attack/defense no damage is taken. If two people generate the same number on speed/precision you generate again

Imagine you have a group of k identical coins. Imagine you have a non-decreasing function value, that takes in a number ranging from 1 to k (inclusive), and outputs a number. The function is non-decreasing, so value(1) &lt;= value(2) &lt;= value(3) and so on and so forth.

How can you group your coins in such a way that their total value is as large as possible?

This is hard to explain in words so let me try to give an example. Imagine if we were doing this problem with k=8: so you have 8 coins, and you have the following value function:

* value(1) = 1

* value (2) = 5

* value(3) = 8

* value(4) = 9

* value(5) = 10

* value(6) = 17

* value(7) = 17

* value(8) = 20

Different arrangements of your 8 coins can result in a different total value. For instance, if you split your 8 coins into 1, 3 and 4, then your total value = value(1) + value(3) + value(4) = 18. If you split your coins into piles of 2 and 6, the total value = value(2) + value(6) = 23. Alternatively, if you just have one pile of 8 coins, then total value = value(8) = 20.

A valid output for this problem is a sequence of positive integers, such that the sum of those integers is equal to k.

The optimal output for this problem (what we want an algorithm to output) is the valid output that has the largest total weight.

I've come up with a method of my own, which begins as a round robin (everyone plays against everyone), and tracks the individual wins and losses of every competitor. Following logic such as b beats c, a beats b, therefore a beats c. Since there is enough information to predict a beats c, a will not compete with c, and that eliminates the number of rounds needed.

&lt;p&gt;a) If an individual is selected, find the probability that the individual’s pressure will be between 118 and 120.8 mm Hg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) If a sample of 30 adults is randomly selected, find the probability that the sample mean will be between 118 and 120.8 mm Hg. Does it seem reasonable that a random sample of 30 adults would have a mean systolic blood pressure between 118 and 120.8 mm Hg? Explain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) Which result is more relevant in evaluating the systolic blood pressure of adults? Why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I'll try to keep this short. I have a sample where numbers range from 0 to 179. 0=180=360 and 90=270. 

These numbers represent the axis of astigmatism of corneas. Since astigmatism usually is ""regular,"" or of equal magnitude 180 degrees apart, we only measure from 0 to 179.


However, because the axis of astigmatism is something measured in degrees, the numbers at the end are actually very close to the numbers at the beginning (since it comes full circle). Aka, 179 could also be considered to be -1, 175 could be -5, etc.


Let's say I want to take the difference between two measurements: 52 and 50 - easy, the difference is 2. But if I want to take the difference between 179 and 1, the difference should be -2 instead of 178.

Obviously, I could get the answer by subtracting 180 from 179 (as above) so that the numbers are closer to the starting point of 0, but I figured we could create an equation that would work with any numbers.

The problem only happens when comparing numbers at the beginning and end of the circle. 

The question is: **is there some way to make a simple equation so that if anybody looked at the measurements and used the equation, that they could easily find the true difference between the numbers?** I was trying to play around with absolute values but couldn't get it to work out perfectly for all numbers.

&gt;""Any time you could mulligan and Serum Powder is in your hand, you may exile all the cards from your hand *(remove the cards from the deck permanently)*, then draw that many cards. You can do this in addition to taking mulligans.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a good way about doing it? Or should I go straight into Linear Algebra. I don&amp;#39;t want to leave any bits out that will come up later on in a more complex format... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

So there is [this](https://youtu.be/O4ndIDcDSGc) Numberphile video were a guy talks about the Gödel incompleteness theorem. He then goes on about undecidability in general and mentions that a strange way of proving RH would be to show that it is undecidable within our system of axioms. Because if it is, it means that we won't find a counterexample to RH since in doing so the problem would become decidable, so there are no counterexamples and so RH holds. Without being sure that this is the correct terminology, I use the word ""undecidable"" to qualify any statement that can't be proven right nor wrong in a given axiomatic system.

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially: ""if I prove that RH is undecidable, then it is decidable, because I then know it's true"". This makes me conclude that you can't prove that RH is undecidable, because otherwise you end up contradicting yourself. So there is my problem. Either this trick of proving RH the guy mentions is essentially useless, or I am confused.

&amp;#x200B;

One way that I get this wrong could be that I mix up the instances when we confine ourselves to our axiomatic system (lets call it S) and the instances when we go outside to ""look in"". Because it could be that the proof of RH undecidability in S is made outside of S. Lets look closely at the steps of my reasoning to see what I mean (brackets for clarity):

1. Assume that we can prove that \[RH is undecidable in S\] in S
2. Then we have proof in S that we cannot disprove RH in S
3. Then we have proof in S that there is no counter example to RH in S
4. Then we have proven RH in S
5. Then RH is decidable in S
6. In total, if we can prove that \[RH is undecidable in S\] in S, then RH is decidable in S
7. Thus we can't prove that RH is undecidable in S

This reasoning seems robust, but the guy was maybe referring to a proof that \[RH is undecidable in S\] that is made outside of S, perhaps in a system S' that is stronger than S, in which case the above reasoning doesn't apply (§1 doesn't hold). But that would raise more questions: What would S' look like? At what point would we regard S' as elementary enough as to be convinced by the proof? Or maybe my reasoning fails elsewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have is ""Is it possible to prove that the Riemann Hypothesis is undecidable?""; if yes where does my reasoning fail? If it fails in §1 the way I considered just above, then what about S'?

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried either branching out (doing sequences like (1), then (1, 2) then (1, 2, 4) to get something like a tree) or counting separate cases like all the single digit sequences (which would be equal to K) then all the pairs with 1 like (1, 2), (1, 3).. (till K-1 cases) but both of them get too tedious and I can&amp;#39;t find a way to simplify this.&lt;/p&gt;

Background: Recently I was playing a video game and wondered if it would be possible to quantify a player’s skill at the game, based on how likely they are to win against another player. So, for example, if player 1 has a 50% chance of winning against player 2, their skill would be equal, because they are evenly matched. I then arbitrarily determined that I have a skill of 1. 
Based on common sense, the following should be true:

- if someone has a 50% chance of winning against me, his skill = my skill = 1.

- if someone has a 100% chance of winning against me, that’s impossible. Unless that person is infinitely skilled there should be at least a chance that I’ll win.

- if someone has a 0% chance of winning against me, that’s also impossible. Unless he has a skill of 0 there should be at least a chance that he’ll win.

That is about where my brain gave up. So, would it be possible to write a mathematical function that calculates a number for skill, given these assumptions? Or were any of my assumptions wrong?

&lt;p&gt;This is because the first card can be any of the 52. The second card must be within that suit, and one of the suit members is taken, so you have 12 options. The third card has 11 options, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's say you have two real-valued, polynomial, continuous functions F and G. (Keep them well-behaved!)

You also have some interval [a, b], with a &lt;&gt; b, such that for all numbers X in the interval, F(X) = G(X). In other words, there's a  interval over which the two functions have equal values, and that interval doesn't consist of a single point.

Does this necessarily mean F and G are the same function?

It seems so, to me: having the same values over the interval means that their ""shape"" is the same. This suggests the derivatives (and all higher order derivatives) are the same as well, if you consider the derivatives as a description of the slope/curve behavior of the function. (I don't know this is true for sure, but it *seems* true.)

If that's true, then call Y the ""first number just outside [a, b]"" which I am well aware is not a real thing -- take the limit as Y approaches b from the right, etc. Intuitively, if the shape of the curve over [a, b] is identical for each function, then the value just outside the interval should also be identical because the behavior of the functions as they ""exit the interval"" are the same. Which means you can expand the interval to [a, Y] with Y &gt; b and still maintain the truth of the statement about the interval.

The same logic should apply with Z approaching a from the left. Accordingly, you can expand the interval to all reals, and therefore the two functions are equivalent because they have the same values over the entire set of real numbers.

This obviously breaks down if you have non-continuous functions or if your interval is only a single number. But if you keep to nice, well-behaved polynomial functions with a an arbitrarily large interval, this seems right.

As soon as one of you much smarter math brains point it out I'm sure I'll have a light bulb moment and go back to my day to day life. 

So the possible combinations of a 4-digit, 0-9 (repeating allowed) password (i.e. a phone pin or bank pin) are worked out online as:

10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000

This made sense to me. However, after looking up the formula for combinations in any kind of scenario I became confused.

I read that the formula: nCr = n! / r! * (n-r)! is used to calculate item combinations, where n = total number of items and r = amount of items to choose. So taking the 4-digit password into account I did:

10! / 4! * (10 - 4)! = 108,864,000

This is obviously incorrect, but I'd just like to know why. What factor accounts for the huge difference in integer size? When would this formula be used as oppose to the basic method used to calculate the correct answer?

The problem is something like:

---

You have a very large number of red and blue coins in a container such that the probabilities of picking them are:

R = 3/4
B = 1/4

You take 10 coins out and put them into a box. What is the chance that your box has exactly 4 red coins? 

---

The way I'm thinking about it is kind of imagining the tree diagram. Follow one branch of it where you get 4 red coins and then 6 blue coins the probability would be 

(1/4)^6 * (3/4)^4

For that particular branch. Now that branch is just one of many ways of getting 4 red coins and so you have to multiply the probability by the number of ways you can get 4 red coins. I thought that for this you should use permutations since that probability is found by considering just one **order** of steps to get the desired outcome of 4 red, or one path down the tree. The actual answer is to use the combinations.

I think I've majorly confused myself here. I can accept that the number of combinations is the number of ways of getting r objects from a set of n.

Today I was watching a video about 'life path numbers' in numerology. I found out something very interesting. I know nothing about math,so sorry if the question is stupid!

Take a random date:
Example 18.10.1995

Add 18+10+1995 
You get: 2023
Add the numbers like this: 2+0+2+3 
It equals 7

If you add the numbers like this:
1+8+1+0+1+9+9+5 
equals 34 and 3+4 is also 7

The second example is the proper way to calculate your 'life path number' according to the video(add up the numbers from your birth date until you get a single digit number) The first example is how I calculated it before watching the video.

I found it interesting,so I tried it with other dates and I always got the same numbers in the end. Can you,math people excuse my broken English and explain why is this happening??","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I was watching a video about &amp;#39;life path numbers&amp;#39; in numerology.

They only mentioned it in a single sentence at the start of the chapter, but had a whole section explaining it in more detail that made it click for me at the end. They even had the formula I was looking for for an unbiased estimate of long term annualised returns based on horizon in the final subsection, [seen here](https://i.imgur.com/naJ2tny.png).

I'm reading a textbook that's talking about time-series stock price data and average returns. It talks about the difference between arithmetic average return and geometric average return. One of the things it says is that if you have a number of years of i.i.d. random returns you can predict the expected return for the next year as the arithmetic average of the historical returns. For example, if you have:

2015: r = 6%

2016: r = 7%

2017: r = 5%

2018: r = 6%

then, assuming that all years are i.i.d, the expected return in 2014 would be 6% (the average of all those years). This makes sense, since they're all taken from the same distribution, so it's like looking at previous rolls of a die to determine the average value obtained when rolling that die.

But then it talks about how the expected EAR over a multiple-year period is not the same as the expected return for a single period. So even if you expect to earn 6% return on average every year from 2019 to 2022, you don't expect to earn:

    1.06^4 - 1 = 26.2%

over that four year period. Instead the expected EAR would be slightly less (something like 5.8% per year), so that the expected four year return would be:

    1.058^4 - 1 = 25.3%

The rationale is that because each year's return is a random variable, and multiple positive variances have a greater effect than multiple negative variances, the arithmetic mean is biased when used over multiple years.

I tested this in excel using randomly generated data from a normal distribution and can see that it's true. Generating 10,000 random returns for three years with a mean return of 6.5% I can see that the average EAR over a two year period is around 6.3-6.4% and the average EAR over a three year period is around 6.25-6.35%.

I'd love to read more about specifically why this happens, because in my textbook it was only given as a footnote. Their rationale doesn't seem to make sense to me because if positive variances had a bigger effect than negative variances wouldn't you expect the EAR to be *larger* than the arithmetic mean? Like by my intuition I'm imagining an example where you expected 6.5% return every year, but some years you got 7% and some years you get 6%. If you get 6.5% two years in a row as expected then you get 13.4% return. If you get 7% two years in a row by variance then you get a 14.5% return: a gain of 1.068%. If you get 6% two years in a row by variance then you get 12.4%, a loss of only 1.063%. So you would gain *more* on average over two years than you'd expect if it was a static 6.5% p.a., not less.

The other thing I'd like to be able to do is work out what the expected return actually is for an n-year period given the expected yearly return. All I know now is that it's less than the expected yearly return itself, but not by how much. I expect the 'how much' is calculated using the variance of the random variable, and it'd be great to see exactly how that works out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Turns out I should have just kept reading the textbook instead of spending hours searching for more info.

&amp;#x200B;

Train fair is currently $4.25.

&amp;#x200B;

Advocates are pushing for that to be cut down to $2.50, which (they suggest) would increase ridership by %33.

I argue that the increase in ridership (33%) does not make up for the $1.75 (41%) cut, and would make for a 22% loss in revenue.

For example, if 100 people ride at 4.25, the train collects $425. If 133 people ride the train at 2.50, the train collects $332.50.

Is this all sound? Also, why does the difference between far cut (41%) and ridership (33%) equal 8%, but the loss is 22%?

To me this seems like a huge gap, so I was curious how many car crashes you'd have to get in to be on par with getting in a shark attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

572\^x=11.5m ; turns out the answer is about 2? So you are just as likely to get into two car crashes as you are get in one shark attack? That doesn't seem right, I know scores of people who have been in two car crashes but nobody in a shark attack, and I would imagine that's true of almost everyone reading this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I doing something wrong? Is log(11.5m)/log(572) not the correct way to solve this? Or am I misunderstanding the stats here, perhaps they are only on any given day where you do both activities? Obviously people drive much more often than they go to the beach, if so then is this right and using log ratio is the proper way to solve this? Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to calculate the speed of a moving sphere after it collides with a stationary sphere. Collision will be ellastic and the stationary sphere will remain stationary. I can solve it analytically using lines and all but I'm trying to implement this on an FPGA and the code will be written in Verilog. So I'm stuck with Integer maths and I can't use trigonometric functions and square root. In addition, I have a little time window to make the calculation so long calculations are problematic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a solution that gives correct answers but it's a long and complex equation to synthesize as a circuit, so I need a simpler approach, that only uses addition and subtraction if possible. Neither nor my friends came up with solution unfortunately. Tha ball will be drawn on a screen.

&amp;#x200B;

Known variables: 

* Center of stationary ball
* Center of moving ball at the instant of collision
* Point of collision
* Speed vector of moving ball:

1. For this vector we have two variables. First one is the amount of movement in the given direction in terms of Pixels. Second one is the amount of clock cycles that needs to pass before the ball moves and is redrawn on the screen. 
2. Amount of movement is constant, that is, ball moves by 1 pixel in each direction when it's redrawn. To change the speed, instead of redrawing the ball after 500000 cycles, we redraw the ball after 400000 cycles so it seemslike it sped up and vice versa.
3. Given above information, we can define the speed of the ball as: v\_x=1/c\_x and v\_y=1/c\_y where c is the amount of clock cycles required before the ball is redrawn.
4. One final note: You can ignor 1, 2, 3 if you don't understand and use a single vector v=(vx,vy). I can make the corrections hopefully.

P.S. What I'm looking for is to find the speed vector after collision, using only vector addition and subtraction if possible but of course all solutions are helpful and welcome.

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much and I can’t wait to see what you guys come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

I perform quality control checks on fueling equipment, one of which is a daily differential pressure (DP) check. (PSI before filtration / PSI after filtration) According to our guidelines, we must record observed DP, and we must also record *corrected* DP. 

Corrected DP in this case represents what the DP would be at the maximum rated flow of the refueling unit. The maximum DP allowed at 100% flow is 15 psi. Basically, we have to calculate the corrected DP to determine whether the DP would be above or below 15 psi if the unit were at max flow. I've asked for years what the formula was and nobody has been able to tell me. Thus far, we've had to use a computer program that figures it out for us, and I'm tired of not totally understanding how it works. Here is the info I know. 

We have something called a curve chart which shows the graph of the Max DP at your observed flow rate. The line representing max DP is curved, hence the name, which also means it is an exponential function, because the differential pressure increases exponentially with flow rate. 

Max DP at 100% flow is 15 psi. Max DP at 50% is 6.5 psi. We'll say that flow rate (%) is x, and DP is y. Basically, the line on the graph begins at (0,0) and ends at (100,15) while passing through (50, 6.5,) and I have no idea how they came up with this graph.

Here is an actual example from April 30, 2019. A refueling unit with a max flow rate of 450 gpm (100%,) observed flow rate of 210 gpm (46.66...%,) and an observed DP of 2 psi, the corrected DP was 5 psi. 

It may as well be magic, apparently, because nobody can prove to me on paper how they came up with 5 psi. I'm about 13 yrs removed from any sort of advanced math, so I'm a bit rusty to say the least. I don't remember the last time I felt this dumb while trying to figure something out.

I am new to reddit and this is my first post.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:**

I have recently been watching the HBO television show Gentleman Jack and have been loving it. I live in Canada, so there are already five episodes out and no spoilers but I have a currency question related to the show. The show is set in 1832 and the protagonist offers to sell her coal pits to a buyer. The price per acre that she offers is 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies). As the inflation rates have significantly changed from then, I was wondering how much this would be in today's currency for context when the characters are talking about prices on the show. I did some calculations last night and was wondering if the method needs to be better and if the answer I received is reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem and solution that I found:**

According to Wikipedia, before 1971, British pounds were divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence, which makes 240 pence (rather than the current division of 100 pence today) per pound. So with the price at 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies) per acre, assuming that each pound is 240 pence (as its set in 1832), amount in pounds = 226\*240 = 54 240 pence, amount in shillings = 17\*12 = 204 pence and then there is 6 pence. The total is = 54 240 + 204 + 6 = 54 450 pence.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this U.K. inflation calculator [https://www.officialdata.org/UK-inflation](https://www.officialdata.org/UK-inflation), I divided 54 450/240 to get the amount in pounds it would be which is 226.875 (as it is unclear to me if this calculator accounts for the 240 pence in a pound pre-1971 issue). Inserting this number into this calculator with the start year at 1832 and the end year at 2019, it's £25,190.91 per acre in today's currency. By using Google's currency calculator, that would be $42, 854.78 Canadian Dollars per acre or $31,883.88 U.S. dollars per acre.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a reasonable answer? Are there any adjustments that must be made to the calculations? Is there a different approach I should have taken to the problem? Please let me know!

I am putting a bid together for a public works construction project and the agency has a limitation on the amount of money that can be charged for the mobilization bid item. There are a total of 27 bid items. It states that the amount that can be bid for mobilization is maxed out at 5% of the amount bid for all bid items not including the mobilization item itself. They do this so contractors can't load their bid up with mobilization money and get paid for work prior to the work being done. I want to put exactly 5% of the sum of all items not including the mobilization item in the bid. I will be receiving quotes from subcontractors right up to the time that the bid has to be submitted so I need to have a formula that allows me to be very fluid and change the values of the bid items quickly. Let's just say that after estimating my job I want to bid it at $5,186,183.00. So I figure that the formula I would need to solve would be:

.05x + x = 5,186,183

I assume that 'x' represents the total dollar value of all 26 bid items that aren't mobilization so that value plus 5% of that value need to equal the total bid. I have no idea why this is giving me fits but I can't figure out how to do it.

&lt;p&gt;If we set the two equal to eachother we get: $\frac{N!}{(n-1)!(N-n)!} = \frac{N!}{(n-1)![(N-1)-(n-1)]!}$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now I am at a loss as to what the next step is.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello all!

I am trying to generate randomized teams with a caveat that each sorting will maximize the number of new people together on a team. This is for a school orientation where we are trying to get people to meet as many new people as possible

Background info: This is for setting up groups for multiple activities in a day. We will have 1 activity where we divide all the people into teams for the event. For the next activity, we want to divide people (same group as in the first activity) into different teams (of a different number of people per team from the first activity) but maximize the number of new exposures so that people are on teams with new people. Then do it again for a third set.

Current thoughts: I was thinking of assigning random values to the groups each time then just sorting by number and making teams this way, but that does not guarantee any level of maximal exposure. The maximal exposure part is what I currently struggle with. I am able to get two unique groups simply with excel but cannot figure out how to make the third group unique. 

Current Excel File: [https://file.io/17DvsS](https://file.io/17DvsS)

Thanks in advance for any and all advice/help you can give.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

I tried it 3 times by hand with a different answer every time. The first two times had arithmetic errors. The final attempt matches what the calculator shows, so I’m not sure if I’m making a mistake or the book has an error (it’s happened before). It’s Precalculus 5th Edition by Blitzer.

The number of ways to arrange the answers randomly is 4^(100) because each question has 4 different possibilities.

Say you put the sequence ABCD on the first place. Then you randomly put all the remaining answers down. This has 4^(96) possibilities. But then, the sequence ABCD can go in any of 97 places, so the probability should be:

97\*4^(96)/4^(100)=97/256.

This is not the complete back and forth but I also gave two examples to ask for clarification on the difference between algebra and arithmetic.

&gt;*So $100 for 10kg = $10/kg is algebra and 100 divide by 10 = 10 is arithmetic?*

&gt;Yes, 100/10=10 is arithmetic. Having $100 and 10 kg and solving for X number of dollars per kg and knowing HOW to set up the arithmetic to solve for X is algebra.

&gt;*20mg of mg of protein in 60ml of urine is 20/60. Isn't that the entire equation?*

&gt;No. 20mg/60mL=0.33mg/mL is the whole equation. And again, 20mg/60mL = X mg/mL, solve for X is what you’re doing really quickly with basic math, but setting up that equation and solving for the unknown is algebra. Someone could say the answer is 60/20=3, and their arithmetic is right (because 60 divided by 20 does equal 3), but their algebra is wrong because they solved for the wrong thing (X mL per mg instead of X mg per mL)

Lastly, I also stated that ratios and fractions can be taught and understood without algebra and that there are both algebraic and arithmetic fractions which means that they are quite different forms of math beyond algebra just giving units or meanings to simple arithmetic.

Unfortunately, my camera software requires yaw, pitch, and roll relative to the aircraft and the calculations from http://www.cosinekitty.com/compass.html are absolute (true north) so I am unable to align my camera to the point when the aircraft is turning and/or pitching.

Some of the aircraft data available that could be useful are: latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity vector x,y,z, yaw, pitch, and roll.

There is no gyro so the horizon will be at an angle when the aircraft is banking.

 I've begun to learn about complex numbers, right now using [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTLkDn9_1Wy5TRYfVULYUw/playlists) lecture series as a stating point.

My question is this: is [this description](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2h77cm/eli5_what_are_the_mandlebrot_and_julia_sets_and/) of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets accurate?

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 1** \- A grocery store stocks 1-gallon cartons of skim milk, 1% milk, 2% milk, and whole milk. A customer is asked to buy 10 gallons of milk. The customer needs to buy at least one carton of each type of milk.

How many different ways can the kinds of milk to buy be selected?

&amp;#x200B;

A: 120

B: 84

C: 210

D: 286

&amp;#x200B;

There are 4 different types of milk. We must acquire 10 in total with at least 1 of each type. Once the 4 are chosen, then we have 6 remaining gallons to acquire. Doesn't the question essentially ask what are the different ways we can choose the remaining 6 gallons from the 4 different types?

In that case, since there are 4 different options for each gallon and 6 gallons to be chosen without regard to arrangement, wouldn't that give us 4\^6/6? (Obviously incorrect because it is too large)

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**Question 2** \- A random experiment consists of tossing a fair 6-sided die repeatedly.

How many tosses are required to be certain that the probability that at least one '6' appears is greater than or equal to 1/2?

A: 3

B: 5

C: 6

D: 4

&amp;#x200B;

A single toss of a fair die would give us a probability of 1/6 to get a 6. If we toss it 3 times, we would get 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 chance to get a 6 so that answer is A. Is this correct?

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**Question 3** \- N is an integer between 0 and 9.

For how many values of N does \[123,3N2\] = \[0\] mod 8, where 123,3N2 is a six-digit number?

A: 2

B: 5

C: 4

D: 3

&amp;#x200B;

Are we suppose divide all variations of 123,3N2 by 8 and see if there are any remainders to determine the number of times 8 evenly divides 123,3N2? In that case, 8 evenly divides the different variations of 123,3N2 4 times so the answer is C, correct?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, why are there square brackets around those numbers - I've never seen them in my reading material but for some reason they show up on the sample test? 

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**Question 4** \- Let N = 12 = (2\^2) + (2\^3)

&amp;#x200B;

Given that (M\^2) = 51 (mod 59), what is (M\^12) (mod 59)?

&amp;#x200B;

A: 7

B: 36

C: 3

D: 30

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some kind of mistake? They assign N in the beginning but then the problem is in terms of M. Anyway, I am quite lost on what to do here. I would appreciate help. How can I tie this information together to get the answer?

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**Question 5** \- Given the characteristic equation: x\^(n + 1) = 2x\^(n - 1), what is it when expressed as a explicit function?  


A: 2 + 2\^n

B: 3 + n x 2\^n

C: 3 + n x 2\^(n + 1)

D: 1 + 2\^(n + 1)

&amp;#x200B;

When I divide the equation by x\^(n - 1), I get x\^2 = 2. If I subtract 2 to both sides, I get (x\^2) -2. At this point, I would usually factor the polynomials to get the value of x but I'm not sure how to do so cleanly so I'm stuck here.

To put a long story short, I analyzed the probabilities involved in a random dice system that another group created, suspicious that their system wasn't actually evenly balanced between two choices (which is what they try to maintain).

----------------------------------------

Here are the rules:

1) Two players choose a ""threshold"" with a range of 100, limited between 0 and 999. For example, player one chooses a threshold of 0-100, while player 2 chooses a threshold of 600-700.

2) Each player rolls a 999-sided die, and compares the results.

3) The higher roll wins, except when the roll falls within their threshold.

3a. - A roll within the player's threshold will win over a roll outside a threshold, no matter what. For example, player one with a threshold of 0-100 rolls a 50, while player 2 with a threshold of 600-700 rolls an 800. Player one wins, for being in their threshold.

3b. - If both players roll inside their threshold, the higher number wins.

----------------------------------------

I ran a simulation of each threshold playing against each other threshold 100,000 times, and these were the results:

Threshold of 0-100 secured victory against:
...
Average win rate = 53601 

Threshold of 100-200 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 52790.1 

Threshold of 200-300 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 52006.2 

Threshold of 300-400 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 51196 

Threshold of 400-500 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 50356.5 

Threshold of 500-600 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 49563.8 

Threshold of 600-700 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 48740.4 

Threshold of 700-800 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 47984.5 

Threshold of 800-900 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 47120 

Threshold of 900-999 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 46379.3 

The tendency for lower thresholds to win is evident, and stays true no matter how many times I run the simulation.

My question is... why? What's the reason behind this discrepancy? I feel as though I have a vague understanding, but I can't quite cement it, or put it into words. Can anyone help me to better understand this?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a random dice system I analyzed is showing the results it did.&lt;/p&gt;

Problem:  
There exist a production cycle where one product is always produced by consuming 3 other products.  The consumed products where also produced somewhen in time by consuming other products and so on. 

To be concrete, a production event E always produces one product P. In order to produce one product P, 3 products C are consumed.  The consumed products C also have each one production event E. Their production event E in turn have 3 products C consumed.

Question:  How can I put the mentioned problem in an equation so that in case I’m interested in a production cycle of say 100 rounds, I can figure out how many products C were consumed in total.

&amp;#x200B;

The quizz consists of 8 questions with 3 statements each (a, b, c). When someone clicks one of the statements, he gets sorted into a small batch of three possible types. There are 9 types in total.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say he clicks statement 1a, he then gets sorted into to groups 9, 8 and 1. In other words: groups  9, 8 and 1 each get awarded 1 point, and the other groups get nothing. With each statement the groups are variable.

&amp;#x200B;

For example question 1 has the following types associated with it

&amp;#x200B;

1a 9.8.1

1b 5.3.1

1c 8.6.4

&amp;#x200B;

The batches of three are variable, so another question might look like this:

&amp;#x200B;

2a 9.5.4

2b 8.7.3

2c 6.2.1

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have already figured out that I can represent the answer statements like this.

&amp;#x200B;

For example question 1

&amp;#x200B;

1a 9.8.1: 110000001

1b 5.3.1: 000010101

1c 8.6.4: 010101000

&amp;#x200B;

I will add to this 10 to the beginning, so when each question get ticked, this number will incrementally update with 1.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have the following series for question 1

&amp;#x200B;

10110000001

10000010101

10010101000

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is the following: I wanted to redirect users based on the score that they have, but I don't think that is possible with the the operators that are available to me. I can just say: when a certain number is greater or lesser than x, redirect the user to answer y.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this is not possible, what I am looking  to redirect them based on an exact score. I can redirect like: when x is equal to y redirect to z.  In other words: I need a of list every combination of answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking if someone can help me create this list, or if it is easy for someone who can help me.

&amp;#x200B;

My list is here:

Q1

10110000001

&lt;p&gt;10010101000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my question is the following: I wanted to redirect users based on the score that they have, but I don&amp;#39;t think that is possible with the the operators that are available to me. I can just say: when a certain number is greater or lesser than x, redirect the user to answer y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is not possible, what I am looking  to redirect them based on an exact score. I can redirect like: when x is equal to y redirect to z.  In other words: I need a of list every combination of answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking if someone can help me create this list, or if it is easy for someone who can help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to only input the draft angle, surface area, and average height of the steel surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking was to treat the surfaces as the outside area of a conical frustum, but I’m not sure I have enough variables to solve for the base and top diameters. &lt;/p&gt;

I realized that in order to paint the whole barrel, I'd be doing quite a few second coats. From there, the question expanded. How many laps around a barrel of slat number N would it take to paint the whole barrel, following the rule paint, skip per corresponding Fibonacci term? I took to the notepad, and things got hairy. 

If we let N denote number of barrel slats, ""turn"" denote how many times around the barrel until all painted, and ""fib"" the Fibonacci term that finishes the barrel, you get (forgive formatting, am on mobile):

N=5; turn=3, fib=5
(Paint slat A, skib B, paint C D, skip E A B, paint C D E A B &lt;--- all slats painted)

N=9; turn=3, fib=13

And so on until

N=14; turn=5, fib=34

Excusing that this is just a curiosity, and probably a silly one at that, is there a more formal way to represent this? Is there an extant investigation? Which branch of mathematics should I go read about to get closer to understanding?

I think my original question was wondering whether there would ever be any N at which at least one slat would always be unpainted, but now I'm more curious as to whether there is any pattern or predictive formula to describe the relationship between N, turn, and fib.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been bugging me. I've seen the correct solution now, but I still don't understand why my solution did not work. My solution found 3 of the 4 answers but did not find all of them. Can someone please help me understand why this approach did not fully work?

&amp;#x200B;

Question: Solve: 9\*tan(2x) - 18\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

Factor out a 9 and divide both sides by 9 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200B;

tan(2x) - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Replace tan(2x) with the double angle formula:

&amp;#x200B;

\[2\*tan(x) / 1 - tan\^2(x)\] - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Multiply all terms by 1 - tan\^2(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200B;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x)\[1 - tan\^2(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Distribute 2\*cos(x) to each term in the brackets:

&amp;#x200B;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x) + 2\*tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Factor out a 2 and divide both sides by 2 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200B;

tan(x) - cos(x) + tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Replace all tan(x) with \[sin(x)/cos(x)\] and cancel one of the cos(x):

&amp;#x200B;

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos\^2(x)\]\*cos(x) = 0

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Multiply all terms by cos(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) - cos\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Replace cos\^2(x) with \[1-sin\^2(x)\] and simplify:

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) - \[1-sin\^2(x)\] + sin\^2(x) = 0

sin(x) - 1 + sin\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

2\*sin\^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Factor this as a quadratic equation:

&amp;#x200B;

(2\*sin(x) - 1\]\[sin(x) + 1\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Set each factor = 0 and solve for x:

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) = 1/2

x = pi/6 or 5pi/6

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) = -1

x = 3pi/2

&amp;#x200B;

These solutions are correct, but so is x = pi/2. Why doesn't this solution show up in my work? Where did I go wrong?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factor out a 9 and divide both sides by 9 to get rid of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tan(2x) - 2*cos(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace tan(2x) with the double angle formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2*tan(x) / 1 - tan^2(x)] - 2*cos(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiply all terms by 1 - tan^2(x) to get rid of fractions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2*tan(x) - 2*cos(x)[1 - tan^2(x)] = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribute 2*cos(x) to each term in the brackets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2*tan(x) - 2*cos(x) + 2*tan^2(x)*cos(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factor out a 2 and divide both sides by 2 to get rid of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tan(x) - cos(x) + tan^2(x)*cos(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace all tan(x) with [sin(x)/cos(x)] and cancel one of the cos(x):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[sin(x)/cos(x)] - cos(x) + [sin^2(x)/cos^2(x)]*cos(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[sin(x)/cos(x)] - cos(x) + [sin^2(x)/cos(x)] = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiply all terms by cos(x) to get rid of fractions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sin(x) - cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace cos^2(x) with [1-sin^2(x)] and simplify:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sin(x) - [1-sin^2(x)] + sin^2(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sin(x) - 1 + sin^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2*sin^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factor this as a quadratic equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2*sin(x) - 1][sin(x) + 1] = 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set each factor = 0 and solve for x:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sin(x) = 1/2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x = pi/6 or 5pi/6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sin(x) = -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x = 3pi/2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These solutions are correct, but so is x = pi/2. Why doesn&amp;#39;t this solution show up in my work? Where did I go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

This isn't a 'homework' problem; it's more of an issue that I've reached the limit of my imagination and can't find a solution.  A friend asked me for help, so I said I'd try.  This equation involves four KNOWN variables and TWO unknown variables, and I've been able to solve for any ONE variable, but not for two.  


This is a formula for calculating ratios of two substances of varying concentrations, expressed in milligrams per millilitre.  The goal is to come up with a mix of the two substances that together give a desired concentration and desired volume.    


The purpose of my question, is to get help devising an Excel spreadsheet to do the calculations for the two unknowns, given the four known variables.  


The variables are:   
a: volume of Substance One, in millilitres  
b: concentration of Substance One, in milligrammes per mL  
c: volume of Substance Two, in mL  
d: concentration of Substance Two, in mg/mL  


x: total volume of Substance One and Substance Two, in mL  
y: product concentration, in mg/mL  


The formulas are:   
( a \* b ) + ( c \* d ) = x \* y  
a + c = x  


wherein b and d, and x and y are defined by user input.  The concentrations of the two Substances are known, as are the desired total volume and desired end concentration.  The values of a and c are the ones I'd like to be able to work out.  


I'm able to come up with formulae for solving for any one variable.  E.G.:   
a = ( c \* ( y - d ) ) / ( b - y )  


... but that's dependent upon another variable I'm trying to solve for, var c .  So I can't plug that into an Excel spreadsheet because it can't crank out a value if there's an unknown in there.    


Here's an example using known values:   
a = 1 mL  
b = 100 mg/mL  
c = 2 mL  
d = 25 mg/mL  
x = 3 mL  
y = 50 mg/mL  


therefore: ( 1 ml \* 100 mg\\mL ) + ( 2 mL \* 25 mg\\mL ) = 3 mL \* 50 mg\\mL   


I know that there's only one possible solution (no pun intended) for vars a and c, if given the concentrations of One and Two, the desired concentration, and the desired volume.

Here's a snapshot of the Excel spreadsheet in progress: yellow fields are user input, grey fields are calculations, and orange fields are for calculated output.  At this point, I put values into the 'output' fields so the 'calculation' fields could have something to chew on.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article revenue decays at 50% per year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to write an equation that graphs out the revenue according to how many days have passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x-axis would be days
y-axis would be revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had something like x/7 * 0.50 &amp;amp; x/365 * 4 = but that didn&amp;#39;t seem to pan out well. I&amp;#39;m trying to get something I can use in excel!&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know if this is a right sub to ask about it but i guess this is were i might get more help. So i have created an experimental mirror in unreal engine 4 software which is a game engine. I hope you know what that is. So what happens is that the camera in game records the view from mirror object and gives a video feed in form of sequential images which are called frames. So i add those images (video) on the mirror object so when player looks at it, it looks like mirror actually reflecting. But here comes the problem. In real world what we see on mirror is actually a horizontally flipped image of what is being reflected and that is how reflection works, pure physics. but I am recording the image through a camera so it showing me a wrong reflection. In order to correct it all i need to do is flip the output horizontally. Now there are many functions and programs in the software that can help me achieve this but no matter what i tried it smartly figured out that i was trying to flip it so it never flipped. as if it was sentient. Like literally. So there is one last option for me and that is to manually mathematically flip the image to get the desired result. So the image is a 2D image of 100x100 pixels. and that's it, no other information and i need it to be flipped. How do i do it? give me some formula and please explain it to me.

So I have a weird and probably super simple math question I'm tangoing with.

I'm making a big meal prep spread sheet, and I've crunched down the calories and macro-nutrients of a recipe using a ratio format, with the key ingredient being the primary factor "" 1:x:y:z "" . For example, I'll have a recipe based around 1lb of chicken with all other ingredients are in ratios relative to said 1lb of chicken to keep cooking / scaling simple for large, multiple person meal prepping. The issue I'm running into is finding an optimal way to make calorie-tight serving sizes. I find out how many servings of ""X"" calories I can make, but every way I've come up with to separate the remainder / leftover seems like it may be more complicated than it needs to be.

For example, I have one ""recipe / ratio"" which comes out to about 1826 calories, dividing into 3.652, five-hundred calorie portions. What I want to figure out is the easiest way to, in the real world, divide my 1826 calories of food into 3 even portions with the remainder of 0.652 of a meal. The unit of measurement of course will be weight, which I don't have at the moment (which should be able to be mathematically translated from the calories themselves).

My attempts and why they suck:

Round up to the next # of portions. (So 3.65 rounds to 4). So if our recipe is 1826 calories, this makes four 456.5 cal servings. We know we want to end up with 3.65 total servings, so we take 0.35 of the fourth serving and distribute it among the original three. This isn't accurate as you have to distribute the 0.35 among the 3 full meals AND the 0.65 of a meal itself. I know I'm missing some super elementary details to make this work but I can't figure out what exactly  and it makes me feel dumb lol.

The other thing I tried that DOES work is dividing all 1826 calories by 3 portions, leaving me with 608.66 calories per portion. From there I could remove the extra 108.66 calories, or 17.85% per serving. This actually works, (which I just figured this out as I was creating the post), but I was still wondering if there is more elegant math or an equation I can plug in that might tell me how to portion things out from the beginning.

Tl;dr:

The idea is to cook the 1826 calories worth of food, weigh it, and then divide it into three 500 calorie portions with the 0.65 remaining off to the side in it's own mini portion for calorie tracking purposes. I have some ways to do so but I want to know if you smart folks have a more elegant solution.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!

Usually the model is made first and a skeleton for animation is created second. I'm exploring the wonderful world of procedural content and ran into an issue with my current solution. 

What I have now: I found a formula that uses radius, theta, and phi to get the x,y,z coordinate for a point on a sphere. It is...

    X = radius * sin phi * cos theta
    Y = radius * sin phi * sin theta
    Z = radius * cos phi

My theta and phi are based on the current iteration index multiplied by the number of radians I need per iteration to reach 2pi. The other is some constant fraction like pi/2 or 5pi/4. Different combinations of 1 being constant and the other being iterative gives me a good variety of angles, but the issue is that the solution does not work for 3d rotations that are not aligned to at least 1 axis. I figure that is because of the constant value during iteration, but when I try to iterate both values I end up with something crazy. 

My goal: what I have now allows me to generate a disc tilted an arbitrary amount with a single iteration. I want to be able to create a disc of points and in that same iteration calculate their XYZ for their final rotation. Traditionally one would generate a disc facing y+ and then do rotation. Or for a *modern* solution, generate the disc, parent the disc to a transform, and rotate the transform. I would like to avoid having to do something like that. 

Some college friends suggested quaternions but I'm not sure how to use them on a set of points or on individual points as they're being generated. If there is some other solution or a way to get the solution I have now to work, I'd really like to know! Thanks. 

A simple example, I would like to be able to create a ring if points the surface of which is perpendicular to the angle between the points (0,0,0) and (5, 10, 10).

--edit: a few more details that come to mind

I'm targeting webgl for the first build. I am not against doing this in multiple steps, I just care about performance. If creating a disc facing y+ and then using a rotation matrix to move all the points will be more performant than doing several sin/cos/etc calculations to get the final point in a single step I have no problem going with that. And since this is a math forum I wouldn't expect that concern to be taken into account and I would be happy to benchmark multiple solutions to see what works best!

--edit 2: I'm targeting webgl so I have threejs to make some boilerplate stuff simpler. I just found out that the geometry buffer class's lookAt implementation applies a transform to its geometry instead of itself (like unity transform would). So I think I will be able to get away with generating a circle of points, setting them as the geometry data for the geometry buffer, using lookAt to move the points, and then adding the tilted points to my target mesh. I will bench mark this against my current flawed solution to see how much overhead (?) this step adds. Might also be worth checking the underlying implementation and using that directly so I don't have to construct a geometry buffer. 

Sorry that got so far off topic from the underlying math!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: I am building a 3d modeling solution that is bone first and model second. Usually the model is made first and a skeleton for animation is created second. I&amp;#39;m exploring the wonderful world of procedural content and ran into an issue with my current solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I have now: I found a formula that uses radius, theta, and phi to get the x,y,z coordinate for a point on a sphere. It is...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;X = radius * sin phi * cos theta
Y = radius * sin phi * sin theta
Z = radius * cos phi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My theta and phi are based on the current iteration index multiplied by the number of radians I need per iteration to reach 2pi. The other is some constant fraction like pi/2 or 5pi/4. Different combinations of 1 being constant and the other being iterative gives me a good variety of angles, but the issue is that the solution does not work for 3d rotations that are not aligned to at least 1 axis. I figure that is because of the constant value during iteration, but when I try to iterate both values I end up with something crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

So the syllabus indicates 6 categories of grades, and each category will average all the grades given for projects and homework in that category. Then those averages are weighted according to how much % that category is of the final grade.

I'm doing numerics and I'm simulating a simple linear pendulum with eulers method.

I understand that the convergence of euler is 1, meaning that by halving the stepsize dt, the accumulated error at a certain time should halve as well.

I simulated the pendulum for one period and then examined the accumulated error for different dt. In my calculations, the convergence rate is much higher than 1, actually roughly 2.2. Is that normal? Is the convergence rate just a lower bound? (I also tried it with half a period and 100 periods)

I'm really confused by this. I also implemented Runge Kutta methods, and with them the convergence rate comes out precisely as expected.

I figured it out. When running the system only for a quarter period T/4 and compare the numerical solution to the analytical result, I recover the convergence rate of 1 for the euler.

I've been trying to find a fair way to balance rolling for stats in D&amp;D.   
How I went about this is assuming the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) is the most balanced. That means an average of 12 and a combined total of 72. I originally went about it like this:   
72=6(x((y+1)/2)) or 24=x(y+1), where x=number of dice rolled and y=maximum possible roll.  
This originally didn't work since I wanted both x to be a positive integer and y to be an even integer. I fixed the problem by assuming you re-roll all 1s, making the new minimum 2:  
24=x(y+2)  
I plotted this function and found some really good settings that worked.   
X|Y  
2|10  
3|6  
4|4  
The table means the players are offered a choice of rollings 2d10s, 3d6s, or 4d4s. On all of these rolls, players will re-roll all 1s.   
The problem I've encountered with my players is so far, the 3 players that have already rolled for stats have achieved totals above 72. All of them chose to roll 3d6s, re-rolling all ones.   


My question: Are these actually fair ways to roll dice assuming a fair average is 12? Is there something I'm not accounting for  that might change the average? If it is a fair way, how can I reduce the the variance in stat totals my players get?   
(As a heads-up, my guess is I did not account for standard deviation and I still would not know how to account for standard deviation in a probability question.)

**Overall Problem**: I am trying to figure out how much money per marketing lead I can spend with each of my 3 marketing partners (I would like to buy from all 3), and how many I should buy for my business to balence cost and optimal sales amounts, as well as making sure my agents are busy the full day. 

  


**Fixed Values Available**:

  


\-My goal 'Cost Per Sale Aquisition' (CPA) - how much I can spend in marketing before I need to see a sale.

\-The number of agents I have

\-the numbers of hours they work new leads a day, and days they work a month.

\-the per agent sales goal amount

\-The average amount of time per connected call.

  


**Sliding Factors** (I have these internal metrics, but don't know how the optimal way to combine them to achieve the best buying strategy):

  


\-The contact rate I get at each 'bid' price level (how likely it is the 'lead' answers the phone, Grouped by dollar amount) 

\-The conversion to sale rate at each bid price level

  


I realize this is complex, but I have feel like I have all the metrics here to put together an equation. Example of the numbers below:

  


\-Monthly Goal CPA: $500 (CPA= Total Cost/Number of Sales) 

\-Number of Agents: 10

\-Sales goal per agent: 20 per month

\-Days worked per month: 22

\-average time working new leads per day: 4 hours

\-Average call time per connected call: 10 minutes.

  


\-Connected Rate (lead to connected call numbers): 

 \-Marketing partner 1: $7-20%, $10-35%, $20-45%

 \-Marketing partner 2: $8-25%, $12-37%, $24-48%

 \-Marketing partner 3: $15 - 50%, $25 - 65%, $40 - 75%

  


\-Conversion rate (lead to sale):

 \-Marketing partner 1: $7-1%, $10-1.5%, $20-3%

 \-Marketing partner 2: $8-1.5%, $12-2%, $24-4.3%

 \-Marketing partner 3: $15 - 3.5%, $25 - 5%, $40 - 9%
