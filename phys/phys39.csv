Earlier today I listened to an interesting interview with Alan Moore. He mentioned his belief that all that happens in the universe is predetermined and recurs forever. He said that this accords with Einstein's (source of the above quote) theory of the universe and also made the rather grand claim that 'most modern physicists' agree with him. Is this true? 

My 'field' is philosophy and it struck me how similar this was to Nietszche's eternal recurrence, which was also referenced by Moore in the interview. That may be a useful point of comparison for my understanding of the topic if you have read any Nietszche. 

My knowledge of physics is limited to having watched Cosmos (I am aware that space-time is a thing) and high school physics so I wondered if someone with a bit more authority on the subject could help a brother out. Links to reading much appreciated.

Cheers!

P.S. I am up for discussing the possible impact of such a theory on moral philosophy if anyone is interested in that side of things.

I'm already aware that different decibel measurements can't be graphed linearly that easy, since decibels work based on intensity (and stuff relating to how ears perceive sound), but I'm very sure that there's a way to demonstrate a linear trend from my results. 

All my measurements so far include:

* Mass of the ball (having a ball means I don't have to worry about the way it lands when I drop it).

* Distance from the decibel meter.

* Ambient decibel levels (the environment). 

* Heights from which the ball was dropped (of course).

* Resulting decibel levels.

dB = 10 x log10(w / 10^-12)

This video has almost 90,000 views and the comments are overwhelmingly positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

This video claims that: ""Quantum mechanics conclusively debunks materialism and the notion of  there being an objective reality or physicality. These notions have been killed since the 1920s. Reality is not material, not objective, and it  is not a linear rational clockwork machine..."" 

&amp;#x200B;

He also says this about quantum fields:

&gt; QM says that there are no such thing as particles (really). Everything  is fields. A particle is really just a field. It is a cloud of  possibilities. When you look upon this cloud with some instrument or  with your own eyes or with your own consciousness what happens is that a  cloud congeals and collapses into a particular result. These fields are  interesting because mathematically a field is an infinite set of  scalars, so that means you take every single point in space and you put a  number on it that will be a field. \[...\] There’s a branch of science  called QFT says that basically everything is a field and reality is an  interaction of different fields coming together, now, what’s interesting  about fields is its nothing but values but values of what? The answer  is nothing. There is nothing there, a field is infinite nothingness.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, at around 53 minutes, he uses an elephant as an example, and he says that according to QM: 

&gt;When you're not looking at an elephant, and this is just a metaphor, that elephant exists as every other animal that it could have possibly been. Think about that and really think through the radical consequences of this, it's enormous. When you're not looking at an elephant, that elephant is literally infinite. It's every possible elephant that could ever possibly be that you could ever see or any other creature could see... not only that but it also exists as a kangaroo, as a chipmunk, as a rhinoceros... and then when you look at it it collapses down into that particular elephant that you see. That's a good metaphor for superposition.

&amp;#x200B;

He then says that when you drop your kid off at school, and you don't see them: ""That child exists as infinity, it's nothingness. When you 're not looking at the elephant it's infinity, it's nothingness.""

 

In the video he also replies to the objection that ""observers"" in physics doesn't have to be a conscious human, and that it could also be a laser or a detector, but he replies to this objection by saying that the laser and detectors and computers exist within your consciousness as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this may seem out there, but I want to keep an open mind, and if this video is wrong, I want to know which claims specifically are wrong and why.

As the title suggests, I'm interested in EM wave degradation and reflection. I understand that it depends heavily on the frequency/wavelength, and I'm interested specifically in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands (Wi-Fi).

My understanding is that the higher the frequency, the lower the the piercing capabilities of said radio waves. My question is, is there an average value of degradation through common materials like a wall? Or through air? i.e passing through a cinder brick wall, a 2.4GHz will degrade by X%, or 5GHz by Y%, or traveling Xm the radio wave loses Z%.

My next next question is similar to the one above. How significant is reflection in the first two situations? For example, would a wall ever reflect more than it lets pass through?

If it helps, I'm only concerned about small areas &lt; 30m

Now i want to prove that the collision happened correctly, that my model works. Just that i dont know how to do that, as i dont know how i can add up translation and rotation.

PS: a bit more about what my model is:
first off my objects are solid and are defined by mass, certain point array and moment of inertia .
currently i dont really care how and if the objects are colliding but rather how they get accelerated by springs. So when 2 objects collide , in my simulation its just 2 objects moving at each other and between a spring, the spring gets compressed,  acts a force on both objects which then gives the objects a certain force and certain torque, the objects get pushed away. If the center of mass of the objects are aligned with the spring, its just a normal conservation of linear momentum, but as soon as rotation comes into play i dont know how to prove that my model works. Miss-aligned there is a case where both objects suddently move downwards and with spin, but then you would think that something has to move upward too so that linear momentum would conserve.

The spring itself is more a construct, it has no mass, and the exerted force is really just calculated by how much it is pressed together without boundaries as followed: F = k*d (F= force, k= constant i randomly appoint to fit my needs, d= distance how far the spring is pressed in (as in d = (length when relaxed) - (current length of the spring))) 

I have to say that my approach is fairly naive as i really just wanted to try to be able to simulate a so called collision even when the bodies can rotate and be able to include cases where for example an object rotates fast, hits another object as then the object accelerates but rotates slower. Like linear and angular momentum are linked together but as i think it works is that angular momentum can be transferred to linear momentum right? I dont exactly know how that works and hope to be able to understand it better with a simulation, in case of only linear simulation it works.

Thanks again and have a good day","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to program a simulation of 2 objects colliding, taking into account that they can rotate and that rotation and speed of the objects change before/after collision.
Now i want to prove that the collision happened correctly, that my model works. Just that i dont know how to do that, as i dont know how i can add up translation and rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: a bit more about what my model is:
first off my objects are solid and are defined by mass, certain point array and moment of inertia .
currently i dont really care how and if the objects are colliding but rather how they get accelerated by springs. So when 2 objects collide , in my simulation its just 2 objects moving at each other and between a spring, the spring gets compressed,  acts a force on both objects which then gives the objects a certain force and certain torque, the objects get pushed away. If the center of mass of the objects are aligned with the spring, its just a normal conservation of linear momentum, but as soon as rotation comes into play i dont know how to prove that my model works. Miss-aligned there is a case where both objects suddently move downwards and with spin, but then you would think that something has to move upward too so that linear momentum would conserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spring itself is more a construct, it has no mass, and the exerted force is really just calculated by how much it is pressed together without boundaries as followed: F = k*d (F= force, k= constant i randomly appoint to fit my needs, d= distance how far the spring is pressed in (as in d = (length when relaxed) - (current length of the spring))) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that my approach is fairly naive as i really just wanted to try to be able to simulate a so called collision even when the bodies can rotate and be able to include cases where for example an object rotates fast, hits another object as then the object accelerates but rotates slower. Like linear and angular momentum are linked together but as i think it works is that angular momentum can be transferred to linear momentum right? I dont exactly know how that works and hope to be able to understand it better with a simulation, in case of only linear simulation it works. &lt;/p&gt;

B. The force of the exhaust gases on the shuttle

C. The force of the shuttle on the exhaust gases

D. If there is no air, then the shuttle cannot accelerate.

I picked B because I thought some force is required to 'push' the shuttle forward.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I am getting a bit tripped up about the scenario where a ball is rolling up an incline and not slipping.

&amp;#x200B;

When I draw the force body diagram, I believe that the normal force points upward, the force of gravity points down and to the left, and the frictional force points right (uphill). Is it right to say that the frictional force must point uphill because the ball must spin clockwise to move to the right? I feel like this might be an incomplete answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, why does the frictional force affect the force, but not the gravitational force? (More explanation into this question below)

sum(T) = I \* alpha

In the light clock thought experiment, Alice (on the platform) and Bob (on a train) are moving relative to each other. Each are carrying 2 light clocks, oriented at a right angles to each other; one is oriented perpendicular to the x-axis, while the other is oriented perpendicular to the y-axis i.e. one perpendicular to the direction of motion and one in-line with the direction of motion.

From Alice's perspective, on the platform shouldn't see the ""time"" speed up and then slowdown in one of Bob's clocks - the clock that is perpendicular to the y-axis - while she will only see ""time"" slow down for the other clock - that is perpendicular to the direction of motion?

Also, if the clocks are set up so that 2 of the mirrors are side-by-side i.e. the top mirror of the perpendicular-to-the x-axis-clock is beside the left mirror of the perpendicular-to-the y-axis-clock, and we imagine the photon in each clock starting from the opposite mirror. Add to this that the clocks makes a click every time it reflects off a mirror.

In the rest frame of the clocks, the photons in each clock would arrive at the opposite mirror simultaneously combining to make one louder click, while according to the observer on the platform, the photons should not arrive in sync and should therefore make 2 distinct clicks.

The velocity of the particle in S can be calculated with E = (m\_0 \* c\^2)/sqrt(1 - v\^2/c\^2)  =&gt; v = (2/3) c.

Similarly, the velocity of the particle in S' comes out to be v' = sqrt(5)/3 c.

Knowing that v = (v' + u)/(1 + v'u / c\^2), where u is the the relative velocity between the systems, I calculated that u = (v - v')/(1-v'v/c\^2)  ≈  -0.156 c.

But according to the solution in the textbook, one can just assume that m'/m = E'/E = 6.7/6 = 1/sqrt(1-v\^2/c\^2) =&gt; v = 0.445 c.

&lt;p&gt;A particle in a system S has a total energy of 6 GeV and a momentum of 4 GeV/c. In a different system S&amp;#39; its momentum is 5 GeV/c. What is the total Energy of the particle in S&amp;#39; and what is the relative velocity of S&amp;#39; with regard to S.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve never taken any classes in English (I did in Spanish and French) and while my mathematical skills are okay, I&amp;#39;ve never done any differential equations for example. I want to learn this summer and I wanted to know if anyone had advice and maybe resources I could look into to get familiar with the English way of saying some terms. Also, what were your experiences as undergraduates in physics? Were you excelling in High School? It&amp;#39;s still way too early for me to look into subfields but I love reading about exoplanets, particle physics and nuclear physics (so basically, three widely different fields). I actually got an internship at a firm linked with the ITER program and am also going to the CEA nuclear research center in a few weeks and gosh, I&amp;#39;m so excited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically,  I&amp;#39;m an anxious ball of stress so sorry if this post sounds pretty desperate and even stupid. Of course I won&amp;#39;t fall behind if I work accordingly but I&amp;#39;d like to know about your experiences. Thank you very much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Does this black hole require every particle in the universe, to simulate every particle? So, how does anyone maintain it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) If the universe can be simulated in a smaller space, then the simulated universe can simulate itself in an even smaller space, and it goes on forever. This means the universe has infinite computation power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) If the black hole can computate what the universe has done in 5 minutes, can&amp;#39;t it predict the future? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all seems paradoxical, so surely to simulate the entire universe, it must require either the same or more space and take the same or more time, right?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm making a roller shade from scratch controlled by the raspberry pi. In my program the user has the option to enter the height of the window in inches to set the max range of travel. this is converted to motor steps for the code to manipulate.

My shades are made from a piece of fabric taped to and wrapped around a 1"" wooden dowel. My theoretical equation is of course : distance = rotations\*pi\*diameter (1""). When I hooked it all up I realized that the diameter is not 1"" but in fact a function of how much of the fabric is still left?

I could use a piece-wise function, say every 6"" use a different diameter, but that is tedious and I know there has to be an efficient solution for this problem.

I've been doing some pondering recently and arrived at an interesting equation, where ꬱ is the age of the universe, M is mass and the other symbols are standard:

**M =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2G**

[Here are the ponderings](https://neophilosophical.blogspot.com/2019/06/is-universe-in-black-hole.html) that got me to the equation.  I didn't actually have it in mind when I started writing, it just developed as part of the process.  I did however, do a lot of searching for ""mass of the universe"", ""density of the universe"",  ""volume of the universe"" and so on to make sure that my results were within the ballpark and I never saw anything like this equation.

&amp;#x200B;

Is **M =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2G** a recognised relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

PS - I'm aware that there are some slight differences from measured values, but they are well within an order of magnitude in all cases.  Note also that I've pondered aloud at the end of the document.  I'm not committed to the musings there, they are merely food for thought at the moment.  I'm also happy to change out ꬱ if there is a standard symbol for the age of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

PPS - (post edit) I've very slightly edited the text above, but I can't do anything about the title.  There's some sort of age of the universe and mass relationship, but it's possible that ""mass of the universe"" was poorly worded (as was mass of the (observable) universe).  I should have been more careful and said ""mass inside a sphere whose radius is the Hubble length"".  I did get the equation via a consideration of the volume of the observable universe (and a volume associated with a sphere with the radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius in which the density is equal to the current critical density of our universe) but I have since noted that I should have been thinking of something that I've called a ""light horizon"" but could also be called a ""Hubble length sphere"" using wording from Sean Carroll.  I've also tightened my wording at the linked article.

&amp;#x200B;

PPPS - (post edit of edit) Nope, ""mass of the (observable) universe"" doesn't work either - edited to reflect.  I still think there's something interesting, but I'm thinking that it might already be understood but I have approached it from such an oblique angle that some experts can't see that I am talking about the bleeding obvious as if it were arcane.  Clearly not being an expert means I can't see the bleeding obvious or put into words why what I am looking at is bleeding obvious :)  Or the critical density having an apparent relationship with the age of the universe could just be no more than apparent after all and, if so, any conclusions drawn from it would likely be wrong.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I did get the equation via a consideration of the volume of the observable universe (and a volume associated with a sphere with the radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius in which the density is equal to the current critical density of our universe) but I have since noted that I should have been thinking of something that I&amp;#39;ve called a &amp;quot;light horizon&amp;quot; but could also be called a &amp;quot;Hubble length sphere&amp;quot; using wording from Sean Carroll.  I&amp;#39;ve also tightened my wording at the linked article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPPS - (post edit of edit) Nope, &amp;quot;mass of the (observable) universe&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t work either - edited to reflect.  I still think there&amp;#39;s something interesting, but I&amp;#39;m thinking that it might already be understood but I have approached it from such an oblique angle that some experts can&amp;#39;t see that I am talking about the bleeding obvious as if it were arcane.  Clearly not being an expert means I can&amp;#39;t see the bleeding obvious or put into words why what I am looking at is bleeding obvious :)  Or the critical density having an apparent relationship with the age of the universe could just be no more than apparent after all and, if so, any conclusions drawn from it would likely be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

I have looked at some past exams but I cannot seem to get to the correct answer without looking at the answer sheet. Its no as simple as use thsi formula type.

&amp;#x200B;

So do you have any pointers on what i need to focus on to pass the exam? The following is the curriculum:

&amp;#x200B;

1 Movement I

2 Force and movement I

3 Working methods in physics We want you to have a basic knowledge of the topics in this chapter, but the methods for calculating measurement uncertainty and graphic leveling are not the syllabus.

4 Energy

5 Amount of motion 5.2: We will not ask you to rely on elastic shocks (where both energy and amount of motion are preserved). Absolutely inelastic shock is the curriculum.

6 Movement II

6.1: We do not expect you to count on integrals, but you should understand that stretch is the integral during the speed-time graph (this also applies in similar cases in other chapters, for example for impulse or work)

&amp;#x200B;

6.3: We will not do tasks with acceleration in two directions at once (oblique throw and corresponding).

&amp;#x200B;

7 Force and movement II

8 Statics 8.3: Mathematical calculation of the center of gravity is not the syllabus.

10 Fluid Mechanics Supplementary Surface tension and capillary forces are available here.

11 Thermophysics I

12 Thermophysics II Supplementary syllabus on diffusion and osmosis is available here.

13 Heat transport

14 Light

15 Geometric optics

Elliptical mirrors are not curriculum.

&amp;#x200B;

We do not expect you to be able to reproduce all the theory of magnesia, microscope, binoculars and telescope, but you should be able to recognize the ray charts and understand what they are showing and understand how to use the lens formula on these systems.

&amp;#x200B;

16 Waves

17 Electricity 17.6 is not the curriculum.

18 Atomic Physics

19 Nuclear physics

21 Gravity field 21.5 is not the syllabus.

This paper looks at a possible resolution of the “problem of time” which arises from the attempt to unify Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR), into a theory of Quantum Gravity. Extending the principle of relativity to the concepts of synchronisation and simultaneity, in Einsteinian Relativity allows for the restoration of absolute simultaneity, which in turn helps to align the concepts of time in GR and QM. A further a change in perspective, as to how time is viewed in physics, shows how time is neither fundamental nor emergent, but is rather a defined system of measurement. This is in the same sense that the metric system [of measurement] - or indeed any other system of measurement - is neither fundamental nor emergent. This is to say that the universe is fundamentally atemporal or “timeless”. In viewing time as a system of measurement, we retain all the functional attributes that are currently attributed to time, in our contemporary physical theories. A relational interpretation of time is retained at the classical level, which can make sense of both the Leibnizian and Machian principles of time, while such a timeless interpretation is indistinguishable from the idea of absolute time. The reinterpretation of “time” as nothing more than a system of measurement also helps to address the issue of background dependence, which is part of the overall problem of arriving at a unified theory of Quantum Gravity. This paper also seeks to address the issue of background independence, albeit less directly.

Not sure if it fits here, but I'll try. Sorry for the poor formatting, done from mobile.

I just did hand calcs for theoretical bending failure of an aluminum rod, and I'm just looking to double check believing my results match reality.

So the parameters of the problem in question:
A 1/4"" Al-6360 rod supporting a 1lb load 1m away.

Made some simplifications to get:

F = 1 lbf ~= **5N**

L = **1m**

r (radius of rod) = 1/8in = **3.175E-3m**

Tensile yield strength = **214MPa**


---------------------------
So, my calculations:

M = L x F = **5 Nm**

I = (pi x r^4 ) / 4 = **7.981E-11 m^4**

Max bending stress = (M x r)/I = **199MPa**

So, what I get from these calculations is that an approximately 1 lb mass at a 1m cantilever distance from the mounting point will cause a 1/4"" Al rod to approach permanent deformation.

I know the question seems pretty random, but I haven't done much applied structural analysis in the past, so I chose numbers like 1 lb and 1 m that I can easily estimate in reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the rather unhelpful title - I'm currently working on a metabolism model as part of a research project, however, hit a problem I am not really capable of solving on my own.

I am measuring the ratio of a set of compounds (A, B and C) in a solution at different time points. The absolute concentration of all of those compounds increases over time due to a constant influx - what I am interested in is what the ratio is in the influx, if that makes sense? The ratio in the influx will start at 100% A, and change over time to a constant, but different ratio - we assume that the majority of our time points captures this stable phase. 

To add a bit more information, what I am looking at are not different compounds, but different versions of the same compounds, differing only in their isotopic composition. The alternative to this approach would be to fully quantitate the different compounds in the influx, but I am somewhat worried about the reliability of this approach in our case.

The first experiment was basically a string attached to two masses, a 50g cork on one side, and a 50g weight hanger on the other. A tube with a paper clip was attached to a known radius of the string. It then involved spinning the upper part of the string with the cork, horizontal motion.

(which I have the feeling wasn't correct) T (period) and frequency also had to be calculated. I divided 30 by the amount of time it took for T, and then divided from 1 for frequency.

Im focusing on part b for this one. Here is how I did it:

To do this I know that I have to use momentum 4-vectors and use conservation of momentum in order to get the final velocity. I am trying to use the conservation of total momenta:

(P + Q)\^2 = (P’ + Q’)\^2

where P, Q and P’, Q’ are the momentum 4-vecotrs before and after the collision respectively. The initial 4-vectors are: P = m(c, v), Q = M(c, 0).

I’m an undergraduate physics student, and just got my first research position this summer. As the title states, I’m wondering how common it is for physics undergrads to have publications under their belts when applying for grad school.


I ask because I’m slowly understanding how much work goes into getting publishable results. We don’t even know if the results will be publishable yet, and in the best case scenario where they are, writing a paper will take a *long* time. Especially since I would be writing it during the semester while taking classes, and it’s only me and my PI working on this project.


I’m freaking out a little because when browsing subreddits about grad admissions, some people are like “oh yeah, I have three publications, one first author” and etc. If one project takes like two years, that just doesn’t seem feasible to me??

I have tried to conceptualize the fission/fusiion process for a long time and have struggled with the traditional binding energy curve explanation you get in textbooks. The below is what Icame up with...does it seem accurate/correct to you?

-----------------

I’m sure you have heard of Albert Einstein’s famous equation E=MC2; you may have even known it was related to nuclear engineering but not known how. What this equation means is that mass is related to energy and energy is related to mass and that it is possible for one to be expressed as the other.


For example as subatomic particles accelerate close to the speed of light (high energy) their mass actually increases tremendously as a direct result of the energy the particle has. That is why particle accelerators (think CERN) have to be so massive to get that extra little push in speed for such tiny particles. (Sadly it is also why we will never be able to travel as fast as light. (Although bending space to effectively go faster than light may be possible.) Energy can be measured as mass and mass can be measured as energy interchangeably. In a loose sense, one can think of energy as having mass.


Okay, now this next part is probably the most intense part of the book, but it is crucial so please read carefully!


It may seem counterintuitive, however the sum of the individual parts of an atom always weigh slightly more than the complete bounded atom. Thus, counter to the old addage, atoms “weigh less than the sum of their parts”. The reason for this is because individual unbound nucleons floating in space have a potential energy with respect to every other nucleon or nucleus created by the strong nuclear force. When nucleons are separated and unbound it is like a ball floating in the air. The ball has potential energy due to gravity compared to the surface of the earth. When the ball falls to the ground it looses that energy just as a nucleon looses energy when it “falls” into and binds with another nucleon or nucleus. 


According to the laws of energy conservation you probably leanred in high school physics, energy must be released in order for there to be an inelastic colission (i.e. where the two objects stick together). For example, two clumps of clay will deform or a falling plate will shatter and make noise. The potential energy has to be disipaited somehow or else the object cannot stay at the lower energy state and will rebound to some degree. The same is true for unbound nucleons. The energy from the binding must be released since the nucleons are going from a higher unbound energy state to a lower bound energy state. As shown with E=MC2 discussed above, that change in energy is reflected as a change in mass known as the “mass deficit” or “binding energy”, the amount of energy released by forming the atom. What is incredible is that this change in mass is real and actually measurable. 


This explains why energy is released when smaller nuclei are fused together in the fusion process. Two smaller unbound nuclei are fused together and release the stored potential energy between them in the process. 

Now at this point you may be wondering how it is possible that putting smaller nuclei together can release energy in the fusion process but breaking apart large nuclei into smaller components can also release energy in the fission process. In actuality, putting smaller parts together always releases energy even in the case of larger nuclei. However, unlike smaller nuclei in the fusion process, the large nuclei involved in nuclear fission have a tremendous amount of potential energy resulting from the electromagnetic repulsion of the protons in the nucleus. When energy is put back into the system via a high energy neutron, the nucleus deforms to the point where the strong force is no longer strong enough to hold the atoms together and the atom explodes due to the electrostatic repulsion caused by the protons. 


In a sense, in fission the energy is the result of the released electrostatic repulsion of the protons (i.e. electrostatic force), whereas in fusion the energy released is due to the loss of potential energy between unbound nucleons (i.e. a result of the strong nuclear force). Just as in the fusion process, uranium atoms also released energy when they were formed eons ago in the center of a star, however that is not what is being harvested in the fission process. 


This explains why so much more energy is released by fusion as oppossed to fission. The nuclear strong force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force (as discussed earlier this is why atoms stay together) so releasing potential energy between nucleons due to binding releases MUCH more energy than that which is released when at large atom explodes due to stored electrostatic repulsion caused by protons.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy all, &lt;/p&gt;

I dont need you to explain me how to solve the following question, because I I already know that I can use the X - Xo = Vot + (at\^2)/2 formula to solve it; my problem is that I dont know why I can't use a=ΔV/Δt instead. So, to the question:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""An object moving with uniform acceleration has a velocity of 12.0 cm/s in the positive x direction when its x coordinate is 3.00 cm. If its x coordinate 2.00 s later is 5.00 cm, what is its acceleration?""

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, my thought process was: if the acceleration is equal to ΔV/Δt, then I need to find the second velocity (the first is given, which is 12cm/s). So, I tried to find the second velocity by doing V=ΔS/Δt, which is = 5-3/2-0, which ended up being 2/2, which was equal to 1cm/s. Once I found that, I tried to find the acceleration by doing a=ΔV/Δt. The first acceleration is 12m/s and the last was 1m/s, and the time was 2 seconds. So I did a= 1-12/2-0, therefore a= -5,5m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer, however, is -11m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200B;

So what was wrong in my thought process? Is it because if a is constant, then I must assume that it is not equal to ΔV/Δt ? If so, why is that? If not that, Is it because a=ΔV/Δt means only average acceleration and I must assume that if a is constant, then it must be instantaneous acceleration? If so, why? (Lol, sorry for the bunch of questions.).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, can I, instead of giving that answer, just maintain what I did, and just change it at the end, putting a= 1-12 = -11cm/s\^2 instead of a= 1-12/2-0? If so, is it because Im supposed to ignore the time somehow or what? And if thats the case, why is that?

That's all... Thank you for your time.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont need you to explain me how to solve the following question, because I I already know that I can use the X - Xo = Vot + (at^2)/2 formula to solve it; my problem is that I dont know why I can&amp;#39;t use a=ΔV/Δt instead. So, to the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An object moving with uniform acceleration has a velocity of 12.0 cm/s in the positive x direction when its x coordinate is 3.00 cm. If its x coordinate 2.00 s later is 5.00 cm, what is its acceleration?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

1. A solid cylinder has a mass of M and radius R.  If it rolls without slipping on a horizontal surface with a linear speed of v, how high will it roll up an incline of angle θ?  Don’t worry about friction. The moment of inertia for a cylinder is (1/2)MR2.  Express the vertical height in terms of the given variables M, R, v, θ and g (some might not be used).



2. The base of a record player is a disk that has a mass of 2 kg and a diameter of 34 cm.  A child spins it so it rotates at a constant rate of 50 times a minute. Neglect friction and anything that complicates the problem. Then, the child drops on a record (also a disk) with mass 1.3 kg and a diameter of 32 cm. How many times a minute will they spin together if the record player base and the record stick together (assume there is no slipping when the record lands on the base)?  Remember, for a solid disk or cylinder, I = ½ MR2.

3. What is the minimum height you would have to place a solid ball of mass M and radius R (I = 2MR2 / 5) on a hill in order for the ball to make it completely around a circular loop at the bottom of the hill?  The diameter of the loop is D. Assume the ball rolls without slipping.

If you increase your velocity through space, you decrease your velocity through time. Because of this, if you move 2 clocks through space, one significantly faster than the other, then when you bring them back together, it turns out that the clock that moved faster is a little behind the other. Motion relativity effects between objects moving significantly slower than the speed of light, then, are pretty much just another layer of relativity on top of this. In addition, the speed of light is a universal speed limit. But, theoretically, if you COULD move faster than light, you'd be reversing causality or going backward in time in some way, or something along those lines. These are my assumptions coming in to this.

Anyway, this brings me to my questions.

First, if it's impossible for an ""object"" (you know, like, something that's not a wave/particle with a velocity of c) to actually achieve the speed of light in space, does that mean the same object also can not fully stop moving? There's probably a temptation here to respond by saying ""stop moving relative to what?"" So to clarify, I mean stop moving in the sense that your velocity ""on the space axis"" in the Minkowski model is zero. The reason I ask is that if it's impossible to achieve zero on the time axis and c on the space axis, shouldn't it also be impossible to achieve zero on the space axis and c on the time axis? And if it IS possible to stop moving on the space axis, why is that? (given that you can't stop moving on the time axis)

Then the second question is this: Whenever I ask the internet, ""why does time only move forward"" or ""why do objects all move the same direction through time"" or some variation on that question, the answer always seems to be ""because the 2nd law of thermodynamics dictates that the universe must move from a more ordered state to a state of more entropy, therefore you can't unmix a cup of coffee and milk."" But this seems to me to be a truism, or in other words, an answer that doesn't do anything more than describe the question in a different way. It just begs the new question, why does everything move from order to chaos? If we go back to the Minkowski model, it would seem that in a universe moving toward a state of total entropy, all objects would simply be reducing their velocity on the space axis and increasing their velocity on the time axis. So I find myself unable to conceptualize any actual relationship between entropy and time at all. Is there actually a relationship there I don't understand? Or can somebody explain why everything seems to move forward in time without using the 2nd law of thermodynamics as an answer?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as I understand it (at least in the Minkowski model), we are always moving at the speed of light through spacetime.

I am pretty stuck with this one homework problem I got about torsion deformation. 

The problem:

*You are observing a hollow shaft (a hollow cylinder with length l, inner-radius r1, outer-radius r2, shear-modulus G) made of steel, which is being driven by a car-engine with power P by a rotational-frequency f. Through the torque T which is being applied on the gear, the two opposite sides of the shaft are rotating in opposite directions with the angle ϕ.*

&amp;#x200B;

*1. Calculate the power dP, which a column with radius r, thickness dr and angle-width of dφ by the rotation performs. calculate first of all the force dF, which the column on the gear executes. Show that P=Tω, with ω=2πf, and express T through the given values.*

I have difficulties grasping the situation, how exactly does the driving of the engine is causing a torsion..? And what is meant by a column..? I think I could handle the computation part, I just really didn't get what the hell is happening in the problem.

for the asteroid with mass m0 (0,0,0,0)

for the asteroid with mass m moving in +ve x: (E1/c, mv1y1,0,0)

for the asteroid with mass m moving in -ve x: (E2/c, -mv2y2,0,0)

where y1/y2 are the lorentz factors for each asteroid. 

For the final momenta I get the two following results:

(E1/c , Mv * y * cos(theta), M v * y * sin(theta),0,0)

(E2/c, Mv * y * cos(theta), -Mv * y * sin(theta),0,0)

This seems fine, they'll both have the same gamma factor moving with the same v, so they have the same y above. The cosine components are the same, but the sin components are opposite signed.

For part ii) I can't figure out how to get this result, if I equate the x-components, I 

1) get a factor of cosine which i can't get rid of

2) get v1 and v2 in the expression 

3) cant use m0 straight away because initially m0 has no momentum

part iii) and iv) are easy enough because I can just use the expression given, but part ii) makes me think I got my 4-vectors wrong?

&lt;p&gt;for the asteroid with mass m0 (0,0,0,0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the asteroid with mass m moving in +ve x: (E1/c, mv1y1,0,0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the asteroid with mass m moving in -ve x: (E2/c, -mv2y2,0,0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where y1/y2 are the lorentz factors for each asteroid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final momenta I get the two following results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(E1/c , Mv * y * cos(theta), M v * y * sin(theta),0,0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(E2/c, Mv * y * cos(theta), -Mv * y * sin(theta),0,0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems fine, they&amp;#39;ll both have the same gamma factor moving with the same v, so they have the same y above. The cosine components are the same, but the sin components are opposite signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For part ii) I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to get this result, if I equate the x-components, I &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) get a factor of cosine which i can&amp;#39;t get rid of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) get v1 and v2 in the expression &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) cant use m0 straight away because initially m0 has no momentum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;part iii) and iv) are easy enough because I can just use the expression given, but part ii) makes me think I got my 4-vectors wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help hugely appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

The problem asks us to justify why the force F1 has to be greater than F2 for the velocity of the box to be constant, assuming friction with respect to the floor is equal in both situations and the masses of the boxes are same. My reasoning is: in the first situation, the effective force pushing the box forward is trivially equal to F1\*cos(alpha), but it is also acting with a force of F1\*sin(alpha) on the ground, so friction is stronger.

There are four main subjects when it comes to physics curriculum..

&amp;#x200B;

Classical mechanics, Electrodynamics, Statistical mechanics, Quantum mechanics.

&amp;#x200B;

Among the four of them I found Statistical mechanics(or, equivalently, thermal physics) to be the hardest one. I actually didn't know why I had to derive Maxwell's identity, Free energy, Gibbs free energy, and something else. So many variables that I'm not sure which variable to choose to describe which system. I think it can depend on what textbook is used during the curriculum.

I used Marion and Thornton for CM(5th edition) during the second year. I should have grasped thorough knowledge of Linear algebra by the time I went through Moment of inertia. I didn't know why I had to get eigenvalues of the tensor back then. But this is a clearly a good book cause it helps to connect classical concepts to quantum mechanics and contains a lot of great problems too.

&amp;#x200B;

Griffiths for EM. It was really helpful to understand how to use vector analysis / calculus. And quite a lot of good problems from the easiest ones to challenging ones. Clear explanation. I also found Wangsness's EM was really great too. I used it as a reference cause Griffiths didn't get deep down in certain topics. Wangsness basically covers everything to prepare you for Jackson.

&amp;#x200B;

Griffiths for QM, which I think is a horrible choice as opposed to EM. But still okay(so so) book.

But the kid's reply was golden I think. He said he that he was worried if the Earth doesn't stay still that his house might not get wifi any more. 

Ignore his understanding of wifi and other stuff for a second, because he did say something that's been bugging me all day. This is what leads me to try and ask you guys these two following questions.

Is it possible to pick out a point in space and never move from that point/spot?

A.) Moving automatically from your point of origin?

B.) Not moving from your point of origin?

For context, I'm a theatre student who is working on a performance project.

Art. But I'm well aware of how impractical that would probably turn out to be in rolling out a container strong enough and large enough to hold me and however much water. Still, it was a fun visual.

That did get me curious though. From what I understand, buoyancy helps reduce the amount of force needed to move an object through water. But does that reduction of work matter at all if you're also moving the water?

For instance, say a neutrally-buoyant ball (or is it more fun to imagine a mermaid?) weighs x grams, and a bucket of water weights y grams. Ifyou put that ball into the bucket of water and then apply force to the side of the bucket, do you have to apply as much force as it would take to move those two weights, x and y, cuminatively? Or does the buoyancy of the ball help reduce the amount of energy needed at all? Does the answer change if the ball is more negatively or more positively bouyant?

I'm having a really hard time studying physics (undergraduate, 4th semester) because it feels so incredibly unrewarding to do so. This issue is not helped by the fact that I do not have any physics related end goal, that physics degree is just going to serve as insurance for a very distant period of my life where I will settle down and my objectives change. For now, I just wish I could do something else. Now that I've managed to come this far I should get this thing over the finish line, though.

So that's why I am here. I want to find out how you guys approach studying and how do you set yourself goals that feel achievable and rewarding on a short-term basis? I am currently tackling quantum mechanics and I've never felt so unsatisfied. I chose to study physics because I'm curious about how things work. But at university level that doesn't come easily. When I read a script or book, I understand nothing on the deepest level. In order to truly grasp it in its entirety I would sit for hours on a single page, looking up and understand the concept behind every single word that I didn't know and re-calculating every equation to fully understand the steps from start to finish. And then I finally feel like having a crack at the problem set and realize I get none of it. Fantastic! Now I don't put in the effort to do this. Feeling like an idiot and working hard for an entire day just to maybe at the end of it come out being a tiny step closer to understanding some part of physics sucks really damn hard.

Is this really how responsible, hard working students approach their studies? In that case I'm in the wrong place. I mean, in that case it's also kinda cool that I came so far with my pathetic work ethic, but surely there must be ways to make studying feel more meaningful and rewarding on a short-term scale. When I work for an hour my brain goes ""Ding! Another hour completed, money in the bank."", when I study physics for an hour my brain goes ""What is this crap? Oh man, I thought I'm smart.

I want to go to grad school when I finish my Bachelors at one of these two schools so I know that research opportunity is a big factor when I comes to being a strong applicant.

I’m not sure which specific area of physics yet, but I’m hoping I would be certain on one soon.

So I know that UCSB is known to have one of the best physics programs (#2 public university in CA, right behind UCB) so UCSB is pretty respected among the “physics world.” I know that UCI has a great physics program as well, but when it comes down to it, does the undergrad university matter? Do grad schools take it as a huge factor when considering an applicant? I heard that students in the College of Creative Studies have high chances of getting into a good grad school because they are well prepped, so I was looking forward to the program. However, I also heard that they don’t care much for transfer students and it’s hard for transfer students to be admitted into CCS. Does anybody have more info on this?

I visited both UCSB and UCI this week and here’s what I thought of it (please don’t think I’m disrespecting either campus because both are really good campuses and this is just my personal take on it)

When I first got to UCSB, I saw a lot of people walking around and immediately saw the chill vibe of the area. But I don’t like the surrounding college town, Isla Vista. I’ve heard about how the landlords are super bad and the housing is overpriced for the small space you get. Don’t get me wrong, I’m into the party scene but it’s just not a big factor I feel like I need. I’m more into partying with friends rather than huge blowouts with strangers. The reason I don’t like it is because it’s pretty messy and dirty. I like working from home and a clean working space is a high priority to me. I envy the students here who are able to balance everything but I feel that if I try hard enough I can get it done as well. I also feel like the buildings are a bit old but the campus overall is alright. However, the building for the College of Creative Studies is a run down yellow box and the the building that says Physics on it (I think it’s offices and labs for grad students) looks like a jail inside. But other than that, the modern side of the library, the Physical Science building and the Engineering buildings are beautiful. I also know that UCSB has the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics but as an undergrad does that matter much?(Aside from sitting in on seminars from physicists that are here for that resource of course). The side by the Lagoon is also beautiful and I really liked it. Another thing I liked was that the beach is next to the school so I can see why a lot of people says UCSB is gorgeous. I’m not a big fan of downtown as well. It’s an okay city with some alright food places but I personally love Asian cuisine and I didn’t find any great boba or pho/noodle spots (I’m sure there are some outside of Goleta).

When I first got to UCI I was amazed at how different it is compared to UCSB. It’s almost a complete flip. The nature and beach was swapped for an extremely clean city with not much of a sense of close community like Isla Vista. I thought the campus itself was also okay but what stood out to me was how close everything is. There’s a little plaza with Target, Trader Joe’s, Chick Fil A etc. literally next to campus. Also the park in the middle of campus seems like a peaceful area (I didn’t like how hilly the inner campus is though). The best thing about going to UCI is that one of my close friends who goes there right now is looking for a housemate for a house 10 min walking distance from campus (so I don’t have to worry about housing). I also know a lot of people who go there but I don’t think this is a big deal because college is about making new friends and forming new connections. But I feel that it should be said because that’s why I’m more certain I will have a better time at UCI. Another big thing is that LA and SD is 1-2hrs away + more food areas. The down sides are that the party life, nightlife, and the physics isn’t as strong as compared to UCSB. However my intuition led me to think this: UCI is still a research university with a lot of resources related to physics. Wouldn’t it be easier to gain research experience here compared to UCSB since not many come to UCI for the physics major? Idk just a thought, might be wrong.

Firstly, sorry for my ignorance, I just graduated high-school and my knowledge in physics is limited to the very basic level of a few subjects that I've learned in school.

So I've finished high-school physics about a week ago and one of the subjects were electromagnetism. We learned about the magnetic field, how it's created and how it affects charged particles or any electric current (Which is obviously many charged particles, so it makes sense).

I know one definition of a field (electric, magnetic, gravitational,  ETC), which is that if you're in the field and you fit a certain requirement (have a mass for gravitational, have a charge for electric, and have a moving charge(?) for magnetic) it applies force on you (We learned Newtonian physics so force is a key word).

The thing is, I know that magnetic fields don't only apply force on moving charged particles, as they affect most metals, so what is the requirement for a magnetic field to apply force on you (apart from moving charge)?

I've tried googling this but weirdly didn't find any answers, I'm sure that I just haven't dug far enough, but I'm sure that a personal answer to my question will be the most effective!

Electrochemical emulsification involves the generation of electrolytic bubbles that attract pollutants such as sludge and carry them to the top of the treatment chamber. Once at the top of the treatment chamber the oil and other pollutants are transferred to a waste oil tank"" 

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if this can be imitated by using common equipment? For example can an aquarium bubbler achieve this separation? Why? Why not? Are there common types of bubblers that can do this? Is it easy to do some diy bubblers that can make this happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was reading about possible ways of separating an oil-water emulsion by bubbling and found these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Flotation&lt;br/&gt;
Flotation introduces gas bubbles to enhance oil removal. The gas bubbles attach to the oil droplets to increase the rise rate of the oil. Various flotation methods such as dissolved gas flotation (DGF), dissolved air flotation (DAF), and induced gas flotation (IGF) may be used. Typically this separation step is used following a primary oil–water separation step which is able to remove a large portion of the free oil.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

So to get the average velocity on the round trip, I would need:

t = t0 / (sqrt (1 - (v/c)^2))

4 months = 1.051 *10^7 seconds.
80 years = 2.523 * 10^9 seconds.

Solve for v:

2.523 * 10^9 seconds = 1.051 *10^7 seconds / (sqrt (1-(v/c)^2)

(1.051 *10^7 seconds/ 2.523 * 10^9 seconds)^2 = 1 - (v/c)^2

1.735*10^(-5) + (v/c)^2 = 1

(v/c) = sqrt (1-1.735*10^(-5) ) = 0.999991325

299,789,857 m/s  * (80 years in seconds) = 7.585*10^17 meters = 80.17 light years (round trip)

Hence, the Overlords' planet is ~40.085 light years away (supposedly in the constellation Carina).


It supposedly took the Overlords ""about an hour"" to accelerate their ships to these speeds (g-force compensators were mentioned).  The simple way to do this would simply be to divide the speed of light by an hour and call that a rough approximation of the acceleration.

HOWEVER, the ""about an hour"" figure comes from the time measured *on the spaceship*.  Up until this point, this was all stuff I learned in high school and I'm a bit rusty.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I have a conducting rod that is entering a magnetic field at some velocity v. I know that a positive charge in the rod moving through a magnetic field will experience a force. So the distribution of positive charges will shift to one side and the imbalanced charge distribution will induce an emf through the rod, having one end of the rod more negatively charged than the other at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: as the rod moves into the magnetic field, there will be cutting of magnetic field lines. Could I possibly use Faraday's law to say that magnetic flux linkage increases, inducing an emf that will oppose the rod's movement into the magnetic field?

&amp;#x200B;

Is a concept like magnetic flux linkage only used for closed loops and not rods? Technically, while rods don't have a number of turns, it does have an area perpendicular to the magnetic field...

&amp;#x200B;

How would the emf graph induced look like? Would it be very small as it enters the magnetic field due to Faraday's law and then increase rapidly once the rod is completely inside the field as there no more change in magnetic flux? Or am I getting some concepts wrong completely?

Consider how a rocket stove works..

There is an inlet where wood is fed into the stove and an outlet for which the exhaust can vent. Very simple but very effective.

Now apply that idea toward a water collection device: 

Instead of using fire and wood use a heating element or alternatively you could use a fresnel lense heating a metal surface with focused concentrated sunlight.

The hot air would rise out the outlet of the stove and I believe this would draw in air into the inlet of the stove. Not sure whether a constriction at the top of the outlet would be ideal to create a pressurized release of heated air that may draw in even more air into the inlet or whether that would lessen the ability.

Zeolite rocks could be placed into where the wood would normally be stacked such that the air would be drawn through the porous material. This would cause the water to bead up and accumulate. You could make a drip pan to divert the water off into a container at that point. 

So my question is:

With wood burning stoves and rocket stoves, there is a lot of air drawn into the stove and often in a lot of airflow (several CFM.) 

Is this condition possible to recreate absent consumables? Could just heating the air make this possible? I know that smoke and the various release of different hydrocarbons have more mass then air alone so that would create more of a draft. Also when fire burns it consumes the oxygen in the air. 

The ideal condition is to have a high rate of airflow going through the device so that water in the air will accumulate in the zeolite and be harvested.

There sure will be some scifi mixed in but I'd like to validate my ideas before I proceed to create something that defies the real world physics (or theoretical) completely.


So basically the idea is that humanity discovered this weird area in the universe where higher dimensional objects interrupt with our 3D universe (oddly enough it's only a local phenomena). People studied it and figured out how to ""stabilize"" these objects and built some kind of a 4th dimensional museum/entertainment park around it - that's the map I'm creating.


The way I think about it is with the 2D creature living in flatland analogy. You could crush it/obstruct its' world from your 3D world right? I wanna do kind of the same with the 4th dimension. There's also another part which says 4th dimension is time. I can crudely imagine both explanations separately but they don't quite come together for me. However I'd like to use them both.


The ideas:
I wanna have areas which are ""stabilized"" (safe for 3D creature to explore) and then unstable areas where objects would be popping in and out randomly and could kill you. 
	
* in safe areas, 4D objects could only be observed visually - have no collision or their collision would be locked in place in 3D
	
* tessaract - I wanted to throw the player inside a (hollow) hypercube but I'm unsure if that even makes sense. Basically you would go inside all 6 (8?) of the cubes in tessaracts' 3D projection and then maybe teleport in another projection of it since that's about everything I could think of. Is that reasonable?
	
* in unstable areas there would be randomly killing 4D objects OR a moving timescale where things would go back and forth in time under your legs. XYZ coordinates would stay the same for you, only the time axis would change so you would see objects in the room moving around in time. This would probably be only a visual thing, done by holograms and animations but theoretically if you move yourself on a timescale to a point where there's a collision in your XYZ at the time, you die right?
	
* at the end you would get sucked into a black hole but I have yet to figure that part out

	
Do these ideas make at least a little bit of sense or does it go against physics too much?
Are there any other interesting 4D ideas I could throw in?

But what Im wondering is there a way to solve for the sunset over a mountain of known height and distance away? Such as in my (shitty) ms paint drawing: https://i.imgur.com/qcN5mC8.png

So my question is, if you know the height of the mountain, and the height of the observer, and the distance between them, and the angle formed from the sunsets, is it possible to work out a solution to the radius of the earth?

I ask because currently in my lab class I am trying to measure the radius of the earth using sunrise and sunset, and both of those have mountains in the way that are seriously affecting our data.

Assumptions you can make:

The distance between the observer and the mountain is essentially just D, and flat, that is to say you can assume that there is no curvature between them (if this helps). 

The mountain is in the range of 5-10 times the height of the observer,  so it doesn't form a near rectangle or anything.

2) what angle am I meant to measure? I presume this is why on one page is saying cos theta while the other sin but I’m not sure. I know  in rotating coils you measure the angle between the normal to the coil and the magnetic field lines. And as emf is max when flux linkage is zero, therefore emf is max when the coil is parallel to field lines therefore the angle the normal makes is 90 which points towards a sin relationship.

5 balls are in an electric field as shown in Fig. 1. Balls A and B are touching eachother, ball D is nonconductive.

1. Which balls will be electrically charged?
2. Ball A is taken out of the electric field and hung using a nonconductive string (Fig. 2).   
Explain what will happen when each of the other 3 balls will be in proximity to ball A.

For question 1 I answered that only ball A and B will be electrically charged (A with negative charge; B with positive charge). Balls C and D will remain neutral.

Question 2 is pretty straightforward as well. Ball B is positively charged and therefore ball A will be drawn to it. Although ball C is neutral, ball A will induce a postive charge to be in proximity to it and will be drawn to it as well. 

My only question is about ball D. Is the fact that it is nonconductive matters to the issue of induction. Or in other words - are nonconductive materials subject to the process of inducing a charge (like with ball C) ?

* The total mass of the rocket (Falcon Heavy centerstage) is 424.6 tonnes, however, the burned fuel changes this to around 30 tonnes.

Light of 430nm wavelength shines on metal plate. The necessary voltage to stop the escaping electrons is .79V. 
If the wavelength is put at 400nm, 1V is needed to stop the electrons. 

a) What value of Plancks Konstant(h) does these measurements give? 

b) What value for the wavelength threshold(f0) does these measurements result in?

I used the 4 given values to create a equations system where I could calculate f0, based on the equation E=Eu + Ek(h*f = h*f0 + ((mv^2)/(2)).

We hear all the time about how processors are running into problems keeping up with moore's law and dealing with quantum interference. However, my understanding is that this is mostly due to limits of silicon, not due to a fundamental physical limit.

As an example, i understand graphine is much faster than silicon (i saw something about possibilities of a terahertz). Superconductivity and/or photonic chips could also make a big difference.

I also know that there's ways to leverage the 'quantum interference' for different types of computation (aka quantum computers).

I've done some googling on this and saw some stuff on black hole computers, but i'm not sure how practical that would be. I would think that even a small amount of black hole material would either slow down the processing speed due to relativistic effects... or it would not be able to stay compressed and explode.

I would also think there would be a thermodynamic limit component as well.

So... what im asking is, assuming the current size of a modern desktop CPU is static for all time, and just based off what we currently know about physics, what is the fastest processor that can be theoretically imagined?

You're supposed to use d'Alembert's principle to find the equilibrium condition, so I understand that the total virtual work must be zero. Since the p-dots are zero in equilibrium, this means the sum of the external forces times their related virtual displacements must be zero. The system appears to only have one degree of freedom, but I'm having trouble relating the vertical displacement in m to the displacement of phi over by M. Am I approaching this the right way? To give some more of my thinking, I'm also having trouble seeing why the radius of the pulley and the length of M don't matter. And do we have to take into account both the slight translation AND slight rotation of M as phi changes? Are there any approximations I'm missing since this is just a small virtual displacement? EDIT: Also, in case the image is confusing, there's an unrelated problem (3.3) between the problem and the figure in question.

I have no background in building anything and neither does anyone I know, so I’m totally at a loss. 

So this project requires that I create some sort of retrieval device that can grab a golf ball from the bottom of a large container of water. The container is a trash can with height: 24 in, base diameter: 19 in, opening diameter 19.75 in. 

Here are the rules:

The device must be activated either while floating within the top 6 inches of water or while being held just above the surface of the water 

It must then retrieve a gold ball from the bottom; everything (device and ball) must end up floating within the top 6 inches of the water in the container. (the ball itself does not need to break the surface of the water as long as it is held by the device within the top 6 inches of the water) 

You may only interact with your device once to activate it in the beginning. After that the device must operate on its own. 

The device may not damage the container. 

The device must be self contained. It may not alter the characteristics of the water in the container by dumping sand, chemicals, salt, etc. 

You may not use any live animals as part of your device (lol). 


Again, I am at a complete loss on how to do this. I have never built anything mechanical in my life and I have no idea what I would even do to make this, let alone what materials to buy or how to assemble it.

But I am not exactly sure how to approach that here with no coordinates and also with the new ""z"" dimension, something I didn't use for previous center of mass problems.

Also, here is the answer: **(5, 3.33)**

Any clarity on this would be amazing and greatly appreciated!

 It has been suggested that a possible transportation system to connect two cities such as Boston and Washington, D.C., might function like this: Drill a tunnel straight from Boston to Washington. A car released in Boston would fall under the influence of gravity, gaining speed, and then finally coasting back to the surface at Washington. The only expenditure of energy required would be that to overcome friction, and this could be reduced by using an evacuated tunnel or magnetic levitation of the train or other possible techniques. Assuming the density of the earth is constant (it isn't), and using only the value of the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface (9.8 m/s2) and the radius of the earth (6380 km) determine how long it would take to travel between any two cities via a straight tunnel.

A 0.25-kg ball is suspended from a string 5 m long and is pulled slightly to the left. As the ball swings through the lowest part of its motion it encounters a spring attached to the wall. The spring pushes against the ball and eventually the ball is returned to its original starting position. Find the time for one complete cycle of this motion if the spring constant is 25 N/m. (Assume that once the pendulum ball hits the spring there is no effect due to the vertical movement of the ball.)

&amp;#x200B;

Quick question about dielectrics. Say you have charged up your capacitor, with a dielectric inside it, and then disconnected it from the power supply. So by Q = VC, as the capacitance decreases but the charge stays the same, the voltage increases. So C decreases, V increases. Then, looking at equations for energy, E = 1/2QV so if voltage increases then the energy increases, and likewise if E = 1/2Q\^2/C, if C decreases then energy increases. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asked to explain why the energy increases once the dielectric is removed. I would have gone straight to use of equations, however, the mark scheme writes:

&amp;#x200B;

Energy increases because: In the polar dielectric molecules align in the field with positive charged end toward the negative plate

Work is done on the capacitor separating the positively charged surface of the dielectric from the negatively charged plate (or vice versa).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss as to what they mean here. Any ideas?

I understand that inserting a dielectric when the power supply is off will increase the capacitance but charge stays the same, so by E = 1/2Q\^2/C, the energy decreases, so the opposite should happen if you remove the dielectric. However, i can't understand why they are talking about the polar molecules of the dielectric. When the dielectric is in the material, the positive poles are attracted to the negative plate, which attracts more electrons to that negative plate.

# TLDR

Trying to use water to store some heat during afternoon and release it at night (or more functionally store cold at night and release it during afternoon).

# BACKGROUND/REASON

I feel like I am overlooking something major. The thermostat is custom code on an omega 2+ which logs multiple temps including outside from the open weather map api. Code is not a simple is temp above/below value =&gt; turn on/off-it looks at stuff like has the ac been running long enough that cooling limit has been reached for this cycle.

Being south Texas and an older house and upstairs, the hot afternoon has been a struggle even with upstairs having a separate ac unit. To help combat this, precooling happens from like 5am to 10am, but this means it gets up to 3.25 degrees colder during that part just to not be 80+ inside mid afternoon.

I had read an article one time about a company that was making ac systems affordable enough for use in houses that freeze a block of ice at night and use it to cool the house during the heat/peak hours (can't find that article again). One day I thought why not make a hybrid form where it is thermal mass in the air return to (more or less) ""release heat at night and absorb it during the day"" which would help the ac unit.

&amp;#x200B;

# SETUP

Been trying to figure out a way to use thermal mass to help in some way, but didn't want to lug a bunch of cinder blocks upstairs. Realized water and copper pipe is my answer. This is still early phase testing/prototyping, which is why it is just 20 feet coiled 1/2 inch copper and no fins, 12 gallon cooler, holes in lid not sealed, and why the coil is not centered (first iteration it was mounted to cooler lid, but that made things difficult to work with). Pump is a 300 gph pump. Started with 5 gallons of distilled water.

# EARLY RESULTS

This is the last week of data. Installing it didn't change behavior, but turning the pump on did stabilize the temp, kinda since it seemed to just not let it get as cool while the upper limit didn't really change. Then tried some experiments where added frozen gallons jugs of water which quickly cooled the water down but didn't seem to affect the air. At some point in there I reduced the water to just under 3 gallons (just before the pump started pulling in bubbles), but again no change.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the past day for a better look (with low/high cutoff hidden since the temp is high enough to not interact with them right now). The pump was off the whole time except for the short bit where the water temp went up. This time I had the flow rate of the pump as low as it would go, which was still a large flow of water and a long/high enough length of tube/pipe/resistance that I had to start the flow with it at a higher rate then turn it down.

# EXPECTATIONS/HELP

My expectations going in to this was that in this configuration it would have a small impact, but be a proof of concept so v2 can do more. Figured when the air is cooling down it would be a little slower to cool, but when it was warming up it would resist warming up some too as the copper/water absorb/release heat. Water flow rate could be used to adjust the impact it had a little bit (or thermostat controls times when pump is on/off).

I'm running out of ideas as to what the problem could be. The only other thing I can think of is if it doesn't have enough water. But a possible error that I am going to test tonight and add the results of is if the pump itself is heating the water up, to test will disconnect the tube from pump and turn it on to see if it makes the same heating curve in water temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

Story is: I studied Nuclear Engineering about six years ago, but left in my senior year due to health and financial issues (was studying in the US but had come from the EU).

&amp;#x200B;

During my senior year I had an idea for an experiment that had to do with the potential of saving a considerable amount of energy in the ignition of a fusion reaction (Tokomak confined) and presented it to two of my professors who assured me that the math is correct and told me that indeed the idea had promise and that I should pursue it for my masters-PhD. As mentioned, getting that far is not an option for me (mainly due to finances) and I was wondering if there would be a way to pursue the experiment otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

Having sent to a couple of research centers where I live, I had my idea turned down without said centers reading the written experiment proposal, as I lack the level of degree to make a proper application - which is understandable. I really don't know how I should move forward with this, or if there is anything I can do about it, but I do indeed feel it is a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways thanks for reading through, and please do let me know if I should post this question elsewhere or any other recommendations you may have. Also, do you think it would be safe to post the actual experiment proposal here?

&amp;#x200B;

How big a difference does the existence (or positioning) of a single human body make on the motion of planets in our solar system, millions of years in the future? I know we can't predict what the difference will be, but do we have reason to think that there likely \*will\* be a non-negligible difference?

&amp;#x200B;

Why might there be a non-negligible difference? Well, figuring out the motion of the planets in our solar system is an n-body problem. So that motion is supposed to be chaotic - highly sensitive to changes in initial conditions. At least, on a timescale of [5 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_time), the positions of planets should be highly sensitive to conditions now. But just how sensitive is an n-body system to \*tiny\* perturbations in the gravitational field? 

&amp;#x200B;

A single human body exerts some small amount gravitational force on nearby planets. So, if I add a single human to Earth's population now, or I move them from one position to another, how much would that change the motion of planets in the future? And over what timescale?

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus questions:

*  Would the differences continue to grow over time, or would they eventually diminish to nothing? (I figure that in a sufficiently chaotic system they'd just keep growing, but would be interested to hear otherwise.)
*  Would the effects be similar on the scale of a galaxy, or beyond?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This is going to be a strange question.)&lt;/p&gt;

Attached photo illustrates question. 


Example A and B are the same lever.

A lever with side L (3m long) has 10 N while side x(1m long) has 25 N of force. To balance the lever side L need only 8.33 N. So there is a surplus on side L of 1.67 N

question: on point B when lever on side x is at a 45 degree angle then comes down on side L with 1.67 N of force until it becomes level to the ground( lever becomes parallel to the ground)
If the 10N on side L as it's coming down becomes level to the ground, at the point where the lever is parallel to ground and the 10N is suddenly removed as the downward momentum is in play, 

will the downward momentum have enough kinetic energy to keep lifting side x with the 25N once 10N is removed on side L?

Or regardless of the downward momentum,  once the 10N is removed will side x instantly begin to move down? 

I hope this is clear but it is kind of complicated for me to explain. I'm thinking once the moment of side L comes down from a distance,  once the 10N are instantly removed when it becomes parallel to the ground it will still have enough momentum to keep lifting the 25N for a foot or so before side x with 25N comes crashing down.

&amp;#x200B;

The particles (w=0.5 mm, l=1 mm) are spinning with an angular velocity that we increment by changing our settings and depending on the spin of each particle, the group swims at a different speed. 

We recorded everything on the lab camera and processed each video resulting in a huge amount of data such as coordinates and angle with the X axis of each particle.

When trying to analyse the angular velocity, we encountered a few problems. 

One of them (comes from the image processing) was that the range of the angle is \[0,180\]. At a very low frequency, the particles align with the X axis, in such a way that a small perturbation results in an angle rapidly switching between a huge value (\~180°) and a very small value (\~0°). We were able to overcome this problem by considering the sinus of the angle. 

The result is a sinusiodal signal whose frequency should give us the angular velocity right?

But the way I understand it, AC should actually loose more power than DC.  Here is why. 

Intuitively I can imagine electrons in a wire like a long string of balls connected by springs, to simulate there repulsive forces, i believe in thermodynamics something similar is done. 

Power is lost because when you push on one end x distance, since the force has to travel across so many springs friction causes some of that force to be absorbed in the compression so that the ball at the end will move &lt;x.  So if you vibrate the first ball in the chain, if the wire is long enough the ball at the end may not even move at all,  in this way I imagine AC current will diminish in a very long wire. 

&amp;#x200B;

But for DC current, when you compress the first ball and continue to push, once the chain reaches its max compression the current would then flow without relativity any more loss, in other words you only have the initial loss of power to get every movement, the opposite would be pulling a loose chain until it is taut, all the pulling until it is taut is doing no work but then the chain is good, as opposed to pulling the chain then pushing it back before it reaches taut, which would be the AC analog.

My job is to add a THIRD BALL and give it a VELOCITY, and a POSITION (Must use a mass of 1kg) so that the momentum of all three colliding balls add up to zero, In addition to this, they must collide simultaneously in an effort to get them all to stick. (Also the collision is 0% elastic).

I believe I have been able to figure out the Velocity of the 3rd ball, using the conservation of momentum. (split into the X and Y direction) like this:

M before=M after

M1+M2+M3=0

M1+M2=(-M3)

So my answers for the 3rd balls velocity:

0.6m/s in the Y direction

0.25 In the X direction

I have a relatively simple question about matter to which I hope a simple answer is possible. 

I understand a small bit about particle physics and field theory in that I read pop science books and articles and find it all fascinating to think about (without ever really grasping the mathematics behind it all).  Nowadays it seems to me that matter is best described as quantum excitations in fields, so Higgs, electromagnetic etc. 

I am sitting at a table here, and the table is made of wood, which is made of different molecules, which themselves are made of different atoms comprising of electrons, protons (made of quarks) and neutrons (also formed of quarks) which are all quantum excitations in their fields.  You could say they are particles outstanding in their fields? Little joke there

So these particles, I presume, don’t actually sustain over the lifetime of the table, or even from moment to moment? If I could somehow identify the particles (which I think is impossible due to the uncertainty principle) would we see that the particles are constantly changing, flashing in and out of existence, but their fields remain, which is what gives the perception of concreteness?  And as the years pass, and the elements break down the table, attrition of particles in the air, rain, whatever else, constantly coming up against those of the table see the table being broken down and dissolved.  Is that correct?

What I’m asking, I suppose, is that from moment to moment, are the particles which make up something solid, actually in flux constantly and at an imperceptible fast speed, or are the particles sort of there, frozen, and remain there until its broken down and changed into something else

Or maybe I’m totally off

&lt;p&gt;But newton says that the faster you move the heavier you get :s ?&lt;/p&gt;

It became dark out and I went to the bathroom or something and got sidetracked (extreme adhd here) and forgot the job wasn’t finished. Now there are little piles around the yard. I am worried because I remembered I have heard grass piles can spontaneously combust, (like an oily rag can do) and I went up north for the weekend. Idk if it’s worse when the grass is still green because of the oils, or when it dries up because it’s so dry. In Michigan, lower peninsula it is about 60 degrees and overcast, a “rainy day” type of day even though it’s not supposed to rain. So at least the sun is not beating down on it or anything. Tomorrow it is supposed to storm basically all day starting at 9 am. But the weather could be wrong (esp for Michigan), should I worry about it if it gets sunny? If it did catch on fire, it wouldn’t really spread because the piles are just in the yard and not next to anything in a ten foot radius. You never know with fires though if you can’t babysit them.&lt;/p&gt;

I have never studied astronomy, all I know is pieced together from articles. Maybe you can help me with these questions about black holes.

1. According to an outside observer, objects falling into a black hole asymptotically approach the event horizon. 

2. Black holes lose mass due to Hawking radiation and eventually evaporate.

#####Questions
1. Although objects become red shifted and invisible, they never cross the event horizon. Is the horizon covered in a lumpy shell of infalling material, frozen in place?

2. Would this shell have a solid surface?

3. As the mass of the black hole increases, would the growing radius of the event horizon cause these objects to pass the horizon?

Ex A is straight forward,  the 10 lbs with a 5 foot arm will lift the 8 lbs with a 5 foot arm

In Ex B my question is will the 10 lbs with 5 foot arm lift the 8 lbs with the 5 foot arm that's curved at a 45 degree angle into the 2 foot arm (7 feet total)? 

Or rather is the way it works, getting the total distance from the fulcrum to the end of the arm which would probably be more like 6 feet rather than 7 feet.

The time for 10 oscillations is recorded for different values of B. \[Diagram\] \[Graph\] (in screenshot). **Write down the time taken for one oscillation when B=0.005T with its absolute uncertainty.**

Attempt: Time taken for 10 oscillations is 8.4 ± 0.21s, so time taken for 1 oscillation is 0.84 ± 0.21, as the dividing quantity does not have an uncertainty, how ever the answer says it is **0.84 ± 0.03 s, accept uncertainty 0.03 or 0.025**. 

My two issues with this answer.

1. Apparently they divided the uncertainty by 10 as well, i thought if you were dividing a quantity without an uncertainty you do not need to touch the uncertainty
2. No way in hell is the error bar ±3s or ±2.5s

I switched majors because it seemed the wiser choice for employment/salary after school.  I was worried about opportunity after I&amp;#39;m finished with school because my impression is that there isn&amp;#39;t much to go around. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be caught unemployed and hurting for money in pursuit of astronomy research.

I have a question about how to use ""thrusters"" to rotate a landing module. For simplicity, it is all in 2D, the red arrows are the direction of the thrusters when they fire and it is upright, yellow is the rotation axis.

I have an inital rotation of the ship thetha, and I want to figure out how much thrust I have to apply on what thruster to rotate it back so the rotation of it is correct again (aka. no rotation). All thrusters always fire orthogonal to the surface they are mounted to.

What I know is (i) the mass of the object, (ii) distance from the thrusters to the axis, and (iii) how much force each thruster can apply in Newtons.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder how I can go from those pieces of information to a change in angular velocity? Or in other words, how I know how many degrees/radians I have turned if I have fired a thruster for *n* seconds with a force of *f* Newtons.

&amp;#x200B;

To solve this problem, I have looked at the formula for torque which seems to be ""T=F\*r\*sin(theta)"". F is the force, r the distance from the axis, and theta is the angle at which the force is applied. In my example, if I would move up the thrusters slightly, this should always be pi/2 because the thrust vector is orthogonal to the surface, so I can simplify to ""T=F\*r"". If I say that I apply 300N and the thruster is 2m away, I apply 600\[Nm\] of force but know I am stuck, and I have no idea how to calculate the change in angle if I apply this force for n seconds.

Not long ago I took part in a discussion about general relativity and the well-known rubber sheet analogy, and it made me realize there was a gap in my understanding of it. I went looking for answers and I believe I managed to fill the gap, but I'd like to hear a confirmation that my current understanding is on the right track.

The rubber sheet is a great tool to understand how gravity can affect photons even though they don't have any mass - while they are always moving in a straight line, this straight line can appear curved without taking the effect of gravity into account. It *seems* to explain attraction of two bodies (a marble will fall into the ""well"" created by the more massive object on the rubber sheet), but that explanation itself requires gravity to work, so that's not really helpful.

This is the gap I was talking about. I understood that mass warps space around it, causing straight lines in its vicinity to appear curved. In addition it causes objects with mass to attract one another. I realized I view these two effects as separate and my original understanding couldn't explain how both of those effects could be explained by a single cause.

Looking for answers, I realized that the rubber sheet analogy fails mainly because it only shows us the effect of gravity on space rather than spacetime. So what I did was to imagine a model that takes time into account. Normally the two dimensional sheet represents our three spacial dimensions, but to be able to fit in time as well, we'll have to further reduce our three dimensional space to just a line, with the other dimension of the sheet representing time.

An object staying in place would keep its spacial coordinate the same while the temporal coordinate would steadily increase as the time passes, effectively moving in a straight line. However, if there's another massive object, the sheet gets warped same as in the original analogy and the straight line representing the object ""staying in the same place"" gets curved towards the massive object, which in effect translates into the attraction.

So what gravity does is that it curves the ""future"" of nearby objects towards its centre, meaning they will be closer in the future, which means that they accelerate towards it.

Is this somewhat correct? Can this model more faithfully represent how gravity works? Are there any obvious problems or shortcomings?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.

This is the question. I did s=vt , so 0.3=10T . So time is 0.03.


Impulse = force x time. so (500)(10) = 0.03 F, so F is 166,666.6666 and so on. But the answer is D. I see that dividing by 2 gives the answer but I don't see why.

 According to Einstein, the faster you get the slower time goes because of time dilation. Currently we are moving through space because of the rotation of the earth, the orbit of the sun around the center of the milky way, the movement of the milky way through space. We are in a particular frame of reference. I know it's not possible, but imagine for a second you stop all motion. Would you experience a kind of ""base time"" (I'll call it t)? What I mean is, is there an ""original"" time out there, t, not dependent on motion, as t' is. With motion it transforms from t to t' according to the frame of reference. Obviously since we are moving our frame of reference is not within t. Does ""base time"" exist, and if so, it is meaningful in anyway? I hope this question makes sense.

I&amp;#39;m not totally sure what I&amp;#39;m going to pursue in undergraduate and beyond, but I&amp;#39;d like to gain the physics knowledge necessary to possibly find an REU during my freshman year. Sorry this post is a little all over the place, but do you have any suggestions for what a person with my aspirations might tackle in high school? (BTW my mathematical knowledge is the equivalent of calc 1 and 2.)&lt;/p&gt;

So I got curious. How much force was exerted onto my hands and why didn't my entire hand get its skin ripped apart and instead only on two places I got hurt. I asked my physics teacher to help me out but sadly she is always really busy with projects and other stuff so she just took a quick glance at this and told me that it's going to be a very tedious thing to calculate. After a bit of counting, I could count about 40 points on my hands where they touch the rope and when I told her about it she said the easiest way to calculate this would be to assume that all of them are the same size and are under the same amount of force. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, no exact calculations can be made unless there is a 3d scan of how I hold the rope so for simplicity's sake let's assume that I held the rope with both of my hands at about 40 points of contact. Let's also say that each point of contact is a circle with a diameter of 1 cm. Considering clothes and boots let's say I weigh about 90 kilograms. The skin on my hands is a bit thicker than a normal person's because in my spare time I go climbing. I am about 190 cms tall and I made  6 steps up from about my waistline to standing upright so let's assume I fell about 4 meters. The fall itself wasn't all that fast I would say about 1m/s but my hands felt quite hot after it. If I were to guess they were probably about 30-40 degrees Celsius and took like 2-3 minutes to cool off. The rope itself wasn't all that rough. Can't say I have used a lot of ropes in my life but let's assume it's a standard roughness one. And I think that's everything needed to set things in motion.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until now, I have been playing around with simple forces. Like two cubes attached together with a string that can be neither compressed nor moved(So basically a pillar with no weight) being pulled or pushed at different angles and having to solve the force that is applied to them, so I have no idea what to do with the 40 points of contact that are on an imperfect object like a hand. I don't even know if they matter or not like for me it sounds logical that you can't just lump them in as one thing that has a force applied on it but for all I know my intuition might be wrong. So any ways I can pull this off with the minimal amount of effort and the highest possible amount of accuracy?

As an 11th grader that thinks he is finally leaning the stuff needed to start solving problems from real life, it sounds like I'm an awful student. What even is the point of studying physics if I cannot even solve simple problems like these?

So while trying to derive the magnitude of the magnetic field of an infinitely long current-carrying wire using the Biot-Savart law, I came across an issue with how the infinitely small line element **dl** is expressed in terms of the perpendicular distance of the point P from the wire ( represented by **d**) and the angle of the line element with the position vector of P with respect to the line element **r**.

The way I did it was to take the angle between the vector **r** and **dl**, as t = π/2 - θ , so the angle between the vector **r** and **d** becomes θ, hence by the definition of an angle in radians dl=r\*dθ. where r=d\*sec(θ), which gives me dl=d\*sec(θ)dθ .

Hey Scientists,

i need to desperatly find the name of a physical theory! It has 11 letters, starting with C (in eng; K in german and 14 letters).

Its propably an ancient greek (astronomic) one!

Let the quest begin!

edit (HINTS I GOT)

\- it english name is connected to a very popular (computer-)game

\- it could be known from physic in school

It is my current understanding that for an observer far from a non-rotating black hole, they never really see matter fall into the event horizon. It just asymptotically approaches the event horizon as its light gets redshifted.

If that's accurate, then I imagine the result for an outside observer is that all matter that's falling into the blackhole should  be seen as an ever-falling red-shifting very thin spherical shell.

Q1: How would any observer ever see a black hole increase in size if nothing ever crosses the event horizon?

Q2: Wouldn't this asymptotic behavior lead to black holes being perceived as an ever red-shifting spherical shell?

The holographic principle and the black hole entropy are related to the surface area of a black hole's event horizon. Since all information that fell into the blackhole is seen as asymptotically approaching its boundary, then all the information whose future is in the interior volume of the event horizon should be compressed in a thin spherical shell on the event horizon.

However, in a question, if I know that there is a frictional force, but do not know its magnitude and am asked to find the work done given the change in kinetic and GPE, I am supposed to use:

initial energy - final energy = work done.

Where has the friction disappeared to in this equation?

Also, initial energy - final energy = -1 \* ( delta(KE) + delta(GPE) + delta(EPE)), which, according to the above equation, is: friction - work done.

So now... The subtler question.

When typical high school/intro undergrad books will say that light slows down in a medium that is not a vacuum. But after reading a bit of Feynman, I'm not sure that is entirely correct: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_31.html

If I'm understanding this chapter correctly, let us set up a situation where we have a light source on the left, a magical field detector on the right; vacuum everywhere, except a sheet of glass in between the two. Then, the source is switched on.

If the glass sheet is not present, then the detector will read oscillating E and B fields corresponding to the frequency of the light being emitted. The time it will take for the detector to sense these changes is how long it takes light to propagate through the vacuum space. So far, so good, I think.

Now, the sheet of glass is positioned between the source and detector, and then the source is turned on. Will there be a difference in the time it takes for the detector to start showing the oscillating E and B fields?

If I understand Feynman's text correctly, the answer is ""no""; in the medium of the glass, the phase velocity of light in the glass has slowed, because the oscillating E field induces an opposing E field in the glass by forcing the charge in the glass to line up/polarize. But the group velocity of light has not changed; throughout all of space, changes in the field continue to propagate at c. So, say, if with no sheet, it took 1 second for the detector to get a reading with no glass present then it should also take the same time--1 second-- for the detector to get a reading  when the glass is present. But, because the distinction between group and phse velocity is a fairly advanced concept, high school students are not exposed to this concept, nor are undergrads until they get to sophomore/junior/senior year, and instead the concept of ""phase velocity slows down"" is shorthanded to ""light slows down in a medium.""

Is this the correct understanding of Feynman's text, as well as a correct interpretation of current understanding about light? Or am I getting something wrong?

Hi all

Probably a silly question, but I was thinking about this last night and can't get it out of my head. Hopefully someone can explain this to me.

Imagine you have a universe that is big and has some (non-trivial) average density of matter. From a point at the edge of this universe, the gravitational effect could be calculated based on an assumption that all of the matter was located at a single point (i.e. the centre of mass of the universe) \[correct me if I am wrong on this\].

So I was thinking that if you made the universe bigger, but kept the average density of matter the same, the amount of matter (proportional to volume) would go up by the cube of the increase in radius, but the amount of gravity at the edge of the universe would increase as you only need to divide by r squared.

Firstly, is the above correct, or am I making a mistake somewhere?

If the above is correct, then it would imply that if you grow the universe (but keep the average density the same, i.e. add uniform shells of matter at the outer edge), then at some point the edge of the universe will have enough gravity to effectively make it an event horizon. So the universe will become a black hole.

The problem I have with this is that shell theorem would say that each shell added should have no gravitational effect on the objects inside it. So to anything inside the universe there is no impact of the universe changing into a black hole. That seems really weird. It also seems to imply that for a given density, there is a maximum allowable size for a universe; is this right?

Again apologies if this is just me missing some really basic stuff, but would appreciate pointers to how to better understand this sort of stuff.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all&lt;/p&gt;

At the instant they see the flash of light they each fire their gun at the opposite individual.

For this exercise, I answered that we should use the parallel axis theorem, and I found Icm = Ip-Md\^2. As far as I understand, this is the moment of inertia parallel to the z- axis? I calculated it, and found the moment of inerta to be 2.94\*10\^-47 kg\*m\^2.

What I don't understand, is how I'm supposed to find the moment of inerta parallel to x and y. Our book only tells how to find the moment of inertia parallel to z, as far as I can tell. I'm not a physics major, so I'm not used to thinking as a physicist would. Am I supposed to use the same formula (Icm = Ip-Md\^2)? 

&amp;#x200B;

My main thought would be to find a calculation between how long it takes for the object's vertical velocity to go up and back down to the ground vs. the time it takes for the object to reach 240m. If T equals time of flight, VL equals the horizontal velocity at time 0, and VH equals the vertical velocity at time 0, then does:

* T = 240m/VL
* T = 2 \* ( VH/9.8m/s^(2) )

The first equation is pretty self explanatory, while the second comes from the time it takes for the object's vertical velocity to decelerate to 0 m/s due to gravity (presumably VH/9.8 m/s^(2)?) which would, since it is launched from ground level, be the same time it takes for it to accelerate back to the ground.

Because the object is launched at a 45 degree angle, you can say that VH and VL are equal, and so VL = VH = VS therefore the true (45 degree) velocity of the object equals VS \* sqrt(2). So by setting the two equals equal to each other you get 240m/VS = 2 ( VS/9.8m/s^(2) ) which gives VS = 34.29m/s and gives the true velocity as 48.49m/s.

This is actually part of my A level course, so although this is partially out of curiousity, it’s also partially a schoolwork question.&lt;/p&gt;

So I thought I had solved this problem but I haven't been able to recreate my solution I came up with a few days ago. Generally I think I keep messing up my algebra but maybe I'm attacking the problem incorrectly.

So Energy initial equals energy final due to conservation of energy

Ei = 1/2m(velocity 1)^2 (kinetic energy only)

Ef = 1/2m(velocity 2)^2 + mgh (kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy)

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(velocity final)^2 + mgh

velocity final is actually (1/3 velocity initial) so

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(1/3velocity initial)^2 + mgh

mass cancels out entirely, and now velocity initial can just be referred to as ""v""

1/2v^2 = (1/2)(1/3v)^2 + gh

this is where I start to get lost in my algebra, I solved for v and ended up with 25.72 m/s for velocity. Assuming g=9.8 and h = 30m

I'm a high school senior that is currently taking AP Physics (Algebra-Based) which I assume is like the introductory course for college level physics. We had the AP Exam for it last Tuesday so we're not actually doing anything for the rest of the month in that course apart from one thing and that's what I'm here to ask about.

I want to get into computer engineering, but the college that I want to go to requires that I take *Calculus* based Physics. The credit that I get for algebra based physics from the exam I took last week does nothing for my engineering curriculum. As such, I signed up for the Physics C: Mechanics AP Exam which is this coming Monday, as this is the exam I need to get a 4 in to have any credit towards my engineering curriculum. 

I'm also in AP Calculus BC, which is the Calculus 2 equivalent in college. I'm doing *really* well in that class and have not a single worry about the calculus AP exam that's happening soon, so I have a good grasp on calculus I'd say. Physics C: Mechanics incorporates lots of calculus topics, since its Calculus based after all. 

I've been looking over a lot of released material for Physics C and my general strategy is to try the problem, and look up a worked out solution if I have no idea how to work it out. A lot of the problems I've looked it are very good questions that I've been able to do with my current understanding of physics, but there are a good handful of problems that I cannot answer. I will say that Physics C problems are worded like actual Physics questions instead of how my Algebra based physics sounded more like an English exam, which I can appreciate. 

My question to anyone that can answer it is basically this: What are some fundamental topics or ideas from Physics C that I should learn myself before I go into this exam? I'm pretty good at regular physics, apart from maybe rotational motion which I could use a brush up on. What else can I do apart from look at released Physics C material?

Here's the solution: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vkJBmHE](https://imgur.com/gallery/vkJBmHE)

I don't understand why (2) is true and (3) is true. I understand why (1) is false.

**What I've tried:**

(1) If the CG (center of gravity) of the chair is directly above the pivot P, then the chair will balance on its own, with or without the wall. The wall merely serves as a decorative purpose in this case and no force (including N and f) is applied onto the chair.

(2) Using the same example as (1), I do not see the need for the ground to provide friction as there is no N by the wall on the chair.

(3) The example in (1) is an example of the statement. Therefore I assume the wall and the ground to be rough, and the CG to be out of PQ.

Before I proceeded, I remember being taught that if the CG of an object (with no walls and only the ground) is above the pivot point, the object will topple over, due to the net moment produced by the weight when taking moments at the pivot point. 

However, in the problem, if the friction of the wall acts upwards, then it could balance the weight. Since there is friction by the wall, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the wall. Since there is a horizontal force (due to the normal force by the wall), the only force that could counteract it is the friction by the ground to the left. Since there is friction by the ground, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the ground.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the problem: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/Q4PGZFf""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/Q4PGZFf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why (2) is true and (3) is true. I understand why (1) is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;ve tried:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) If the CG (center of gravity) of the chair is directly above the pivot P, then the chair will balance on its own, with or without the wall. The wall merely serves as a decorative purpose in this case and no force (including N and f) is applied onto the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Using the same example as (1), I do not see the need for the ground to provide friction as there is no N by the wall on the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

While measuring the temperature from inductive heating of samples of ST52-3 (low-alloy steel, ferromagnetic) and 1.4301 (Chrome-Nickel, non-magnetic) I've stumbled upon a sudden change in the temperature-gradient at around 550 degrees Celsius for the ST52-3 steel (see [https://ibb.co/8bb46Yc](https://ibb.co/8bb46Yc)). I was wondering if this is the curie-point? According to different articles, the curie should lie at \~750 degrees Celsius for low-alloy steels, which gives rise to my question.

\[; F\_B = F\_T - F\_B ;\]

\[; F\_B = P\_T A - P\_B A ;\]

&amp;#x200B;

Theres observer A at rest at the origin in inertial frame S. Observer B is on a train moving with speed v = 0.6c (60% speed of light) along the positive x-axis relative to A. S' is the frame of B. Observer B passes observer A at the origin (t = t' = 0). After time dT, observer A flashes a light. B also flashes a light, but after observer A's time dT measured by observer B's clock. Another observer, C, moves along the x-axis as well with speed u. C observes both of the flashes from observer A and B simultaneously. What is C's velocity?

&amp;#x200B;

So here we have 2 batteries in a circuit connected so that the electrons are flowing on two parallel lines which join then loop around to the anode.  But in the drawing, the current is flowing from the anode(I think) of the 17.5 V battery to the anode of the 4 V battery, then out the Cathode of the 4V battery to the cathode of the 17.5 V battery. Sorry if that's unclear

&amp;#x200B;

Now I understand the difference between a galvanic and an electrolytic cell, and that in theory pushing electrons and energy the ""wrong way"" through the battery will result in the non spontaneous reaction occurring. But that isn't what is happening here. Somehow the current is entering the anode, where it would then proceed to reduce the anode, but instead not only is it not being reduced, it is somehow oxidizing the Cathode through what I suppose would be the salt bridge, and this doesn't appear to have any negative effects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently it ""doesn't matter what way you draw the current"" but then why not draw it correctly? And besides, every time I do draw what reasonably makes sense to me I get it wrong, and when I bring it to the teacher the first thing they do is draw the damn circuit like the picture above. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain how this picture is physically possible? Or where I'm mistaken in my reasoning? Or hopefully some way to do these that makes sense? 

&amp;#x200B;

Preferably without the starting phrase ""forget everything you know about how circuits work and draw the current going in random directions. I sort of get the junction and loop rules, but I can't actually apply them because the positive/negatives don't follow any rhyme or reason.

The situation is as follows: (image)

\- zuidpool means south pole, noordpool means north pole.

There is a current through a coil, ABCD in the direction DCBA. The coil is in a homogenic magnetic field. This forms a Lorentz force in point P. The strength of this force is 1.6N

&amp;#x200B;

**The question is;** create a graph of how Fl on side CD changes in one turn of the coil.

&amp;#x200B;

Since Fl = BIl \* sin(alpha) I would assume that I get a sinusoide line.

&amp;#x200B;

If the coil turns 45 degrees (0 &lt; sinus(45) &lt; 1) that would not result in a full force but somewhere in between. So I would assume that on time T1/8 there should not be a full force.
