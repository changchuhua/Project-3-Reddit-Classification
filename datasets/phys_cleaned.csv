"How to excel in a physics undergraduate degreeThis post is for advice, I'm starting college next week and this college isn't my dream college, it doesn't have the best physics program, with most of the students just studying there to get a degree and then go for an MBA or something. What would be your advice if you have experienced something similar? I at least want to get a master's degree too. Do you know of anything helpful to distinguish yourself as a serious 'physics person' ? ( I mean self studying some kind of math or studying deeper into a topic or something like that, I have no idea what I'm talking about)",1

"Lagrangian Mechanics and Generalized ForcesSo I'm doing some Lagrange's equation problems and I'm having a bit trouble understanding when generalized forces aren't zero.

Using [this expression]( I'd assume that for a the case of an object free falling, the weight would make the generalized force for the generalized coordinate not zero. Same thing happens with the Atwood machine, why are the generalized forces zero, when the sum of the forces acting on each of the masses (tension and weight) would be non zero?

Edit: for clarification, my confusion stems from [this]( expression.",1
"Does pressure in a sealed container rise as it ascends in altitude?The source of this discussion is talking about inflating an inflatable stand up paddleboard at lower altitude and then driving it up to a mountain lake. These paddle boards have a stiff strong structure that holds their shape. They are designed to hold aprox. 15psi. If someone was to fill the paddleboard to 15psi say at 4,000ft altitude, then drive it to a mountain lake at say 8,000ft altitude, will the pressure in the paddleboard change from the change in altitude or is 15psi in a container, 15psi regardless of ambient pressure?",1

"Measurement accuracy of the speed of lightI'm aware that the speed of light is defined to be 299792458 m/s, and that since 1983 the length of a meter has been defined with reference to that value.

According to Wikipedia,

&gt;After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be 299792458 m/s  \[...\] with a measurement uncertainty of 4 parts per billion.

This seems a small amount of uncertainty, but not necessarily so small that an improvement (say to 1 part per trillion) would be practically insignificant.

If measurements of the speed of light were to improve, such that scientists would (in theory) want to add a decimal place to the previous value of c and be confident that this was more accurate, then--unless they were to just ignore this result--according to SI rules the length of a meter would have to change very slightly, in order to preserve the correctness of c = 299792458 m/s.

Google hasn't enlightened me regarding whether, as of 2019, the speed of light has been measured more accurately than it was in 1975, or 1983. Does anyone know whether this is the case, and if so whether the length of a meter has changed since then?",1

"Quantum Teleportation... In just 100 Years? I never found this concept particularly interesting until now. Reading an article from… I think it was The Guardian, I was certainly intrigued at the least. In this article, it said that American physicist, Michio Kaku thinks that problems of waiting for millions and millions of years and hogging the world’s power supply could be solved in just about a hundred years. It says that “he envisages a teleporter that works like and ultra high-res MRI scanner, with accuracy at the single-atom-per-pixel level.” A question from me to people more experienced in this field: Do you personally feel that Kaku is right, considering we have only teleported photons?

"'The persistent illusion of transience'Hi all,

Earlier today I listened to an interesting interview with Alan Moore. He mentioned his belief that all that happens in the universe is predetermined and recurs forever. He said that this accords with Einstein's (source of the above quote) theory of the universe and also made the rather grand claim that 'most modern physicists' agree with him. Is this true? 

My 'field' is philosophy and it struck me how similar this was to Nietszche's eternal recurrence, which was also referenced by Moore in the interview. That may be a useful point of comparison for my understanding of the topic if you have read any Nietszche. 

My knowledge of physics is limited to having watched Cosmos (I am aware that space-time is a thing) and high school physics so I wondered if someone with a bit more authority on the subject could help a brother out. Links to reading much appreciated.

Cheers!

P.S. I am up for discussing the possible impact of such a theory on moral philosophy if anyone is interested in that side of things. It has always struck me that the laws of science seem to be at loggerheads with our understanding of morality. How can we have free will if we know that all matter in the universe acts and interacts in accordance with certain rules?",1
"What are ways of conveying Decibels into more graphable units (e.g. Watts, joules)?So I'm doing an assignment where I have to conduct my own science experiment, and I've chosen to do one that relates to the law of conservation: I drop a golf ball and measure the volume of the impact, in decibels. The independent variable is the height from which I drop the ball. 

I'm already aware that different decibel measurements can't be graphed linearly that easy, since decibels work based on intensity (and stuff relating to how ears perceive sound), but I'm very sure that there's a way to demonstrate a linear trend from my results. 

All my measurements so far include:

* Mass of the ball (having a ball means I don't have to worry about the way it lands when I drop it).

* Distance from the decibel meter.

* Ambient decibel levels (the environment). 

* Heights from which the ball was dropped (of course).

* Resulting decibel levels. 

So while I have lots of numbers written down, I'm not too sure what to do with these. The most legitimate formula I've seen and can use would be:

dB = 10 x log10(w / 10^-12)

Where dB is the decibel level, w is the power of the sound wave (in watts) and 10^-12 is supposed to be the ""reference power"" (something about the atmosphere, also in watts). 

Am I actually on the right track? If not, what are the correct formulas that I use?",1

"DC Motor coils questionHi reddit, I have a question about the differences between a single, 2, and 3 coil DC motor that I have to answer in a lab report. In the prac we built a single coil motor and a 4 coil motor, now there is a discussion about their differences. This is the full question. 

""Discuss in detail the motor operation as compared with a single coil motor. Include an explanation of the starting position. What factors could affect the motion of the rotor?

"Could physicists fact check this video for me? It's called ""Quantum Mechanics Debunks Materialism""[ video has almost 90,000 views and the comments are overwhelmingly positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

This video claims that: ""Quantum mechanics conclusively debunks materialism and the notion of  there being an objective reality or physicality. These notions have been killed since the 1920s. Reality is not material, not objective, and it  is not a linear rational clockwork machine..."" 

&amp;#x200B;

He also says this about quantum fields:

&gt; QM says that there are no such thing as particles (really). Everything  is fields. A particle is really just a field. It is a cloud of  possibilities. When you look upon this cloud with some instrument or  with your own eyes or with your own consciousness what happens is that a  cloud congeals and collapses into a particular result. These fields are  interesting because mathematically a field is an infinite set of  scalars, so that means you take every single point in space and you put a  number on it that will be a field. \[...\] There’s a branch of science  called QFT says that basically everything is a field and reality is an  interaction of different fields coming together, now, what’s interesting  about fields is its nothing but values but values of what? The answer  is nothing. There is nothing there, a field is infinite nothingness.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, at around 53 minutes, he uses an elephant as an example, and he says that according to QM: 

&gt;When you're not looking at an elephant, and this is just a metaphor, that elephant exists as every other animal that it could have possibly been. Think about that and really think through the radical consequences of this, it's enormous. When you're not looking at an elephant, that elephant is literally infinite. It's every possible elephant that could ever possibly be that you could ever see or any other creature could see... not only that but it also exists as a kangaroo, as a chipmunk, as a rhinoceros... and then when you look at it it collapses down into that particular elephant that you see. That's a good metaphor for superposition.

&amp;#x200B;

He then says that when you drop your kid off at school, and you don't see them: ""That child exists as infinity, it's nothingness. When you 're not looking at the elephant it's infinity, it's nothingness.""

 

In the video he also replies to the objection that ""observers"" in physics doesn't have to be a conscious human, and that it could also be a laser or a detector, but he replies to this objection by saying that the laser and detectors and computers exist within your consciousness as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this may seem out there, but I want to keep an open mind, and if this video is wrong, I want to know which claims specifically are wrong and why.

Anyways, I've always wondered why we cant travel faster then the speed of light, and everyone once in a while I will look up the question again. Every time I look it up the answer I get is the same. There is not enough energy in the universe to travel that fast. My question is, Is it actually against the laws of physics to travel faster, Or is it just impracticable and not possible with the resources we have. 

In the case that I'm right and it is not actually against the laws of physics, why is it always stated it is? It seems like something a physicist would not say is impossible, kind of like if you asked them if unicorns are possible, I think they would answer yes, even thought we don't know if they are, because it is not against the rules of physics. Obviously this case is a bit different because it is impossible given everything in the universe, but we don't definitively know whats is beyond what we can see right?

As the title suggests, I'm interested in EM wave degradation and reflection. I understand that it depends heavily on the frequency/wavelength, and I'm interested specifically in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands (Wi-Fi).

My understanding is that the higher the frequency, the lower the the piercing capabilities of said radio waves.

Or through air? i.e passing through a cinder brick wall, a 2.4GHz will degrade by X%, or 5GHz by Y%, or traveling Xm the radio wave loses Z%.

"how do you prove that the summ of momentum of 2 objects in a closed system stays the same when both objects move and rotate?I wanted to program a simulation of 2 objects colliding, taking into account that they can rotate and that rotation and speed of the objects change before/after collision.
Now i want to prove that the collision happened correctly, that my model works. Just that i dont know how to do that, as i dont know how i can add up translation and rotation.

PS: a bit more about what my model is:
first off my objects are solid and are defined by mass, certain point array and moment of inertia .
currently i dont really care how and if the objects are colliding but rather how they get accelerated by springs. So when 2 objects collide , in my simulation its just 2 objects moving at each other and between a spring, the spring gets compressed,  acts a force on both objects which then gives the objects a certain force and certain torque, the objects get pushed away. If the center of mass of the objects are aligned with the spring, its just a normal conservation of linear momentum, but as soon as rotation comes into play i dont know how to prove that my model works. Miss-aligned there is a case where both objects suddently move downwards and with spin, but then you would think that something has to move upward too so that linear momentum would conserve.

The spring itself is more a construct, it has no mass, and the exerted force is really just calculated by how much it is pressed together without boundaries as followed: F = k*d (F= force, k= constant i randomly appoint to fit my needs, d= distance how far the spring is pressed in (as in d = (length when relaxed) - (current length of the spring))) 

I have to say that my approach is fairly naive as i really just wanted to try to be able to simulate a so called collision even when the bodies can rotate and be able to include cases where for example an object rotates fast, hits another object as then the object accelerates but rotates slower. Like linear and angular momentum are linked together but as i think it works is that angular momentum can be transferred to linear momentum right? I dont exactly know how that works and hope to be able to understand it better with a simulation, in case of only linear simulation it works. 

I apologize to not be able to shorten this and that this whole project is rather shaky but im thankful for everyone reading this, ""wasting their time"" and trying to help me.

"Ball rolling up an incline question(s) :)Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I am getting a bit tripped up about the scenario where a ball is rolling up an incline and not slipping.

&amp;#x200B;

When I draw the force body diagram, I believe that the normal force points upward, the force of gravity points down and to the left, and the frictional force points right (uphill). Is it right to say that the frictional force must point uphill because the ball must spin clockwise to move to the right? I feel like this might be an incomplete answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, why does the frictional force affect the force, but not the gravitational force? (More explanation into this question below)

&amp;#x200B;

My teacher has an example problem with a ball rolling up the hill, and the answer key looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

sum(T) = I \* alpha

Ff \* r = (2/5)\*r^(2) \* alpha

&amp;#x200B;

Why does my teacher say that the force of friction is the force behind torque, instead of Ff - Fg? (So it would look like (Ff - Fg) \* r = (2/5)\*r^(2) \* alpha)

"Time Dilation in a 2 Clock set-up
In the light clock thought experiment, Alice (on the platform) and Bob (on a train) are moving relative to each other. Each are carrying 2 light clocks, oriented at a right angles to each other; one is oriented perpendicular to the x-axis, while the other is oriented perpendicular to the y-axis i.e. one perpendicular to the direction of motion and one in-line with the direction of motion.

From Alice's perspective, on the platform shouldn't see the ""time"" speed up and then slowdown in one of Bob's clocks - the clock that is perpendicular to the y-axis - while she will only see ""time"" slow down for the other clock - that is perpendicular to the direction of motion?

Also, if the clocks are set up so that 2 of the mirrors are side-by-side i.e. the top mirror of the perpendicular-to-the x-axis-clock is beside the left mirror of the perpendicular-to-the y-axis-clock, and we imagine the photon in each clock starting from the opposite mirror. Add to this that the clocks makes a click every time it reflects off a mirror.

In the rest frame of the clocks, the photons in each clock would arrive at the opposite mirror simultaneously combining to make one louder click, while according to the observer on the platform, the photons should not arrive in sync and should therefore make 2 distinct clicks.

However, I keep hearing people link the observation of a quantum phenomenon with its state of certainty.

Is the act of conscious observation of a particle legitimately implicated in it being in a certain or uncertain state? Is ""observation"" here just describing whether or not a particle theoretically *could* be observed, regardless of whether it is(e.g. interacting with other particles in a way that would allow observation, if that's even how that works)?

I know that in a vacuum a hammer and a feather fall at the same speed.

On Earth everything regardless of mass falls with a certain acceleration speed A and on Mars everything falls with another acceleration speed B.

I don't understand how this can be true regardless of mass, because it leads to different results depending on the perspective if you use really immense masses.

Okay, but what would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer with the mass of Earth onto Mars? From the perspective of Mars you would expect them both to accelerate at speed B

Mars-hammer onto Earth is the same scenario as earth-hammer onto Mars, but you get two different results depending on which side you are looking at it from.

"Problem regarding special relativityThe following is given:

&gt;A particle in a system S has a total energy of 6 GeV and a momentum of 4 GeV/c. In a different system S' its momentum is 5 GeV/c. What is the total Energy of the particle in S' and what is the relative velocity of S' with regard to S.

The first questions is not problematic. Given E\^2 = m\_0\^2 \* c\^4 + p\^2 \* c\^2 one can easily calculate that m\_0\^2 \* c\^4 = 20 (GeV)\^2 and thus E' = sqrt(45) GeV  ≈  6.7 GeV.

When I tried to solve the second question I did the following:

The velocity of the particle in S can be calculated with E = (m\_0 \* c\^2)/sqrt(1 - v\^2/c\^2)  =&gt; v = (2/3) c.

Similarly, the velocity of the particle in S' comes out to be v' = sqrt(5)/3 c.

Knowing that v = (v' + u)/(1 + v'u / c\^2), where u is the the relative velocity between the systems, I calculated that u = (v - v')/(1-v'v/c\^2)  ≈  -0.156 c.

But according to the solution in the textbook, one can just assume that m'/m = E'/E = 6.7/6 = 1/sqrt(1-v\^2/c\^2) =&gt; v = 0.445 c. I don't really understand why my approach is wrong and why the v in the textbook solution is automatically the relative velocity of the systems.

"Grade 11 Physics - Mechanical WavesI am having some confusion regarding mechanical waves. Some of the wave reflects invertly when going from a less dense to more dense medium, or when a wave comes in contact with a fixed end. Waves reflect upright when going from a more dense to a less dense medium, or when a wave comes in contact with a free end.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my confusion: Aren't mechanical waves faster, the more dense the medium is?

In my answer key for my homework, when the wave is going from a high speed rope to a low speed chain, the wave is reflected inverted. And when the wave is going from a low speed chain to a high speed rope, the wave is reflected upright. I am confused.

If we follow what the question says, isn't a low speed chain a lesser dense medium, so since it has a lower speed, the wave should be reflected inverted when going from the low speed chain to the high speed rope? Similarly, when going from a high speed rope to a low speed chain, shouldn't the wave be reflected upright?

Based off what my answer key is saying, is the high speed rope the lesser dense medium, and the low speed chain the more dense medium, and why? Does the behaviour of speed with regards to density change when it is in a rope?

I understand from a real world perspective, a chain is more dense than a rope, but this counteracts what I have been told in the question.",1

"Making sense of carrier particlesHi everybody. This is not exactly my field of study (I'm a PHD student in chemistry), but I'm very fascinated by all aspects of physics, and I always like to have at least an intuitive understanding of every topic I come across. 

If I understand correctly, the modern interpretation of the 4 fundamental forces is that they are in essence caused by an exchange of particles (gluons, for example). This, to me, makes no sense at all. I see a particle exchange as a single event, a point in time, whereas the force experienced by two particles is something constant (For example, the idea of the gravitational force as a deformation in spacetime makes sense to me). Furthermore, how does the information about interactions ""travel"" and get exchanged through these particles?

People usually say quantum mechanics does not make sense intuitively; personally, I disagree. Quantum mechanics requires you to abandon your ""version"" of intuitive understanding; it requires you to realize that what you consider *obvious*, what makes sense immediately to you, is just a product of you being born and raised in an environment in which the physical laws assume a particular form (due to large masses in comparison to subatomic particles and small velocities in comparison to the speed of light). This is just to say that I believe there must exist an intuitive way to describe this idea of forces being exchanges of particles, and I kindly ask you to try and find it. :)",1
"What factors decide whether a plasma is generated from electric potential?Context: I'm trying to build a DIY sputtering rig. 
For anyone unfamiliar with the concept, sputtering deposits one material onto another. This is achieved by generating a plasma with high voltage, which bombards one electrode with ions, causing molecules to migrate from that end onto whatever it is you are sputtering onto.

I'm stuck on getting the plasma to form though. 

I have a glass chamber, which I pump out as much air as I can from, flush it with Argon and repeat a couple of times. 

I then have a metal bottom lid and an insulated wire going to the top end of the glass jar. I have applied several different voltages to these electrodes, up to 25 kV, without getting a plasma to form. I keep getting either arcs or just a corona effect, but no full blown plasma.

* I think a higher vacuum would be good. I've only measured it with a jury rigged meter, but I estimate it's probably around 0.2-0.3 bar. I can't do much about this right now though.
* The high voltage right now is a heavily offset AC. It could be seen mostly as a pulsed DC source though. 2-4 kHz, ~15 kV, ~10-15 mA. This ought to suffice I think?

But the major thing I'm unsure of is the electrode shapes. As I mentioned, I am getting some corona effect on the top wire.

"Illuminated lightbulb on lamp casts a shadow when using a flashlightI noticed if you shine a flashlight on an illuminated lightbulb in a lamp it will cast a shadow behind the lightbulb. Is this shadow just a contrast to the surrounding brightness around the bulb or is the light from the flashlight illuminating the inside of the lightbulb of the lamp to make it white which reflects the other light and thus making a shadow? 

So whatever the case, you can pretty much direct light to cast a shadow behind another light. If that area behind the lamp bulb represented a 1 when illuminated and a 0 when there is a shadow, It is useful to have the ability to make that area dark without having to turn off the lamp but instead use light. 

I bet you could make a logic tree based on the speed between different lights and the shadows created along its travel. In computing you have the transistor to gate the signal but with the path of the light and another light you could simulate gating.

I want to learn this summer and I wanted to know if anyone had advice and maybe resources I could look into to get familiar with the English way of saying some terms. Also, what were your experiences as undergraduates in physics? Were you excelling in High School? It's still way too early for me to look into subfields but I love reading about exoplanets, particle physics and nuclear physics (so basically, three widely different fields). I actually got an internship at a firm linked with the ITER program and am also going to the CEA nuclear research center in a few weeks and gosh, I'm so excited. 

Basically,  I'm an anxious ball of stress so sorry if this post sounds pretty desperate and even stupid. Of course I won't fall behind if I work accordingly but I'd like to know about your experiences. Thank you very much!",1

"Wave vector K -Condensed MatterI'm studying the module Condensed Matter (as an extra), with near-to-no knowledge of Quantum Mechanics. I can follow the class to an acceptable standard but there's one concept that is repeated throughout the course implementing the wave vector which i just can't wrap my head around.

&amp;#x200B;

The wave vector seems to produce a |sinusoidal| line on a plot of Wave Vector K (on x-axis) vs Frequency (on y-axis) in relation to a chain of atoms in 1-dimension. Why is the wave vector causing a maximum at an interval of pi/a (where a is spacing between atoms)?

"Force of an electromagnetThis is similar to another post about a month ago that someone else made( u/Poker1059 ) but his question was never answered so hopefully someone can help this time around.

I have an old microwave oven transformer that I pulled the primary coil off of to create an electromagnet. I'm going to be using a bench power supply that supplies 12 Volts with no current limiter. My multimeter says that the wire's resistance is .94 Ohms. This puts the current running through the electromagnet at about 13.3 A. It's a DC electromagnet so it should follow Ohm's Law.

"Problem in momentum(?) and collisions.The question goes as follows :

"" A ball is projected from the ground at a velocity V\_ball = 50 m/s inclined at an angle theta = 60 degrees to the +x-axis.  A wall is moving at a constant speed V\_ball = 5 m/s along the -x axis (opposite in direction to the ball). The ball collides with the wall, which has a coefficient of restitution of e =0.7, and bounces back to fall to the ground. Where does the ball hit the ground after collision if :

1. It collides at y = maximum height of the projectile,
2. It collides at y = half the maximum height of the projectile
3. It collides at an instant where its velocity = V\_ball/2

**You may not use the equation of trajectory.** (The parabola equation relating the y- and x- coordinates) ""

I tried taking the velocities to the frame of the wall, but the second equation required to solve this doesn't seem to strike me. Also, we are not given the masses of the two bodies and the answer is expected to be numeric.

What I have recognised so far:

* The wall being there only affects the horizontal component of velocity.
* In part 1) the vertical component of V = 0.
* In the frame of the center of mass of the system, relative velocity of separation = e(relative velocity of approach)",1

"Stern Gerlach experiment: Uniform magnetic field at an angleMy 3rd year class and I are writing Atomic on wednesday: 

No one has been able to make ends of the solution we were provided with for this question:

A beam of spin-1 particles, moving along the y axis, is incident on two collinear SG apparatuses, the first with B feild along the z axis and the second with B along the z' axis, which lies in the xz plane at an angle `$\theta$` relative to the z axis. Both apparatuses transmit only the uppermost beams. What fraction leaving the first will pass the second?

&amp;#x200B;

The solution given: 

Particles exciting the first filter will be in the (1, 0, 0)\^t (transpose)  state (S(z) basis). Particles passing the filter will be in the eigenstate of the `$B \cdot S$`  opperator, which is = B(cos \* S(z) + sin \* S(x))  (which becomes a matrix of cos and sin). 

The solution then states that the spin up eigen vector is 1/2(1+cos, sqrt(2) sin, 1-cos). 

Then the inner product \^2 of this with the spin up z basis vector is  1/4 (1+cos(theta))\^2.

"Problems with a Simulated UniverseI recently watched a video made by PBS Spacetime about how to simulate the entire universe. (  ) Basically you can simulate every particle in the universe within a black holes event horizon roughly the size of Sagittarius A, and this same black hole could compute every computation the universe has done in 13 billion years, in 5 minutes. But I see some problems with this.

1) Does this black hole require every particle in the universe, to simulate every particle? So, how does anyone maintain it?

2) If the universe can be simulated in a smaller space, then the simulated universe can simulate itself in an even smaller space, and it goes on forever. This means the universe has infinite computation power. 

3) If the black hole can computate what the universe has done in 5 minutes, can't it predict the future? 

This all seems paradoxical, so surely to simulate the entire universe, it must require either the same or more space and take the same or more time, right?",1

"Heat load of a Peltier cloud chamber.So I'm currently working on designing a cloud chamber cooled via peltiers, I haven't really touched physics much since high school so this is kinda me trying to get back into physics. It's still in the designing stage because I've hit a road block. The issue is I'm not really sure the heat load they'd be under. A lot of the guides I've read or watched don't go into detail on trying to figure out what Peltier to use and heat loads.

I've got a 11.99 diameter, 2mm thick copper plate around 202 grams(I used an online calculator that takes the dimensions and gives the weight). Copper needs 0.385J/g to rise 1 degree, so I just calculated how many joules would be needed to make 202grams of copper go from 0c to 50c. I assume that going from 20 to -30 would give the same answer. 202 x 50 x 0.385j = 3,888.5 joules. The time taken to cool the plate down will take awhile due surface area and I'm thinking of ways to improve that. But the issue I can't figure out is the heat load from the environment(be it from the air or the Isopropyl in the chamber, or heat transferring in from outside the glass.)

I guess my question is; is the heat load in this case from the copper, and would the ambient air temperature make a big difference to the system? And if so, how would I go about figuring out the heat load it'd contribute?",1

But this can't mean that the speed of the other car is completely irrelevant right? If we keep the first car's speed the same, what if the second car is traveling at 25 mph? Or 100 mph? I'd assume the accident is worse when the other car is traveling at 100 mph.

"Relationship between the age of the universe and the mass of the universe?Hi,

I've been doing some pondering recently and arrived at an interesting equation, where ꬱ is the age of the universe, M is mass and the other symbols are standard:

**M =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2G**

[Here are the ponderings]( that got me to the equation.  I didn't actually have it in mind when I started writing, it just developed as part of the process.  I did however, do a lot of searching for ""mass of the universe"", ""density of the universe"",  ""volume of the universe"" and so on to make sure that my results were within the ballpark and I never saw anything like this equation.

&amp;#x200B;

Is **M =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2G** a recognised relationship?

PS - I'm aware that there are some slight differences from measured values, but they are well within an order of magnitude in all cases.  Note also that I've pondered aloud at the end of the document.  I'm not committed to the musings there, they are merely food for thought at the moment.  I'm also happy to change out ꬱ if there is a standard symbol for the age of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

PPS - (post edit) I've very slightly edited the text above, but I can't do anything about the title.  There's some sort of age of the universe and mass relationship, but it's possible that ""mass of the universe"" was poorly worded (as was mass of the (observable) universe).  I should have been more careful and said ""mass inside a sphere whose radius is the Hubble length"".  I did get the equation via a consideration of the volume of the observable universe (and a volume associated with a sphere with the radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius in which the density is equal to the current critical density of our universe) but I have since noted that I should have been thinking of something that I've called a ""light horizon"" but could also be called a ""Hubble length sphere"" using wording from Sean Carroll.  I've also tightened my wording at the linked article.

&amp;#x200B;

PPPS - (post edit of edit) Nope, ""mass of the (observable) universe"" doesn't work either - edited to reflect.  I still think there's something interesting, but I'm thinking that it might already be understood but I have approached it from such an oblique angle that some experts can't see that I am talking about the bleeding obvious as if it were arcane.  Clearly not being an expert means I can't see the bleeding obvious or put into words why what I am looking at is bleeding obvious :)  Or the critical density having an apparent relationship with the age of the universe could just be no more than apparent after all and, if so, any conclusions drawn from it would likely be wrong.",1

The moment of inertia for a cylinder is (1/2)MR2.  Express the vertical height in terms of the given variables M, R, v, θ and g (some might not be used).




I assumed that this was a conservation of energy problem. So I set up the following equation

mgh= KE(trans) + KE(rot)

mgh= 1/2(mv^2 ) + 1/2(Iw^2 )

I= 1/2 (MR^2)---&gt; sub this in


v (cm)= rw---&gt; w= v(cm)/r---&gt; sub this in 

mgh= 1/2( mv^2 ) + 1/2(1/2 ( MR^2 ) × w^2 )


mgh= 1/2mv^2 + 1/4(MR^2 × v^2 / r^2 )


mgh= 1/2mv^2 + 1/4mv^2


gh= 3/4v^2

"Request for Feedback: The Atemporal Universe - Resolving the Problem of TimeI've written (or at least tried to write) a paper on the problem of time. It's a  philosophy of physics paper. Any feedback (preferably constructive 😁) would be greatly appreciated. A critique of the ideas is of primary interest, but i know the formatting and structure need a lot of work too. Anyway, here is the abstract from the paper:

This paper looks at a possible resolution of the “problem of time” which arises from the attempt to unify Quantum Mechanics (QM) and General Relativity (GR), into a theory of Quantum Gravity. Extending the principle of relativity to the concepts of synchronisation and simultaneity, in Einsteinian Relativity allows for the restoration of absolute simultaneity, which in turn helps to align the concepts of time in GR and QM. A further a change in perspective, as to how time is viewed in physics, shows how time is neither fundamental nor emergent, but is rather a defined system of measurement. This is in the same sense that the metric system [of measurement] - or indeed any other system of measurement - is neither fundamental nor emergent. This is to say that the universe is fundamentally atemporal or “timeless”. In viewing time as a system of measurement, we retain all the functional attributes that are currently attributed to time, in our contemporary physical theories. A relational interpretation of time is retained at the classical level, which can make sense of both the Leibnizian and Machian principles of time, while such a timeless interpretation is indistinguishable from the idea of absolute time. The reinterpretation of “time” as nothing more than a system of measurement also helps to address the issue of background dependence, which is part of the overall problem of arriving at a unified theory of Quantum Gravity. This paper also seeks to address the issue of background independence, albeit less directly.

"Physics 1 - Am I doing this final velocity problem correctly(they want the velocity with an angle)?Something with a mass of 1700 kilograms moves with the initial velocity +13 m/s in the x direction. -29,000N in the y direction is exerted on it for 0.37 seconds.

I found the acceleration in the y direction:

F = ma

-29,000N = 1700kg * a

a = (-29000 kg m/s^2 ) /(1700kg)

= -17.1 m/s^2 

Then I found the velocity in the y direction:

velocity = -17.1 m/s^2 * 0.037s

= -6.31 m/s

Then I added the 2 vectors together and solved for the velocity using pythagorean theorem

vf = sqrt[(13 m/s)^2 + (-6.31 m/s)^2 ]

= 14 m/s

I then found the angle by doing 

tan theta = -6.31 m/s / 13 m/s

theta = tan^-1 (-6.31 m/s / 13 m/s)

theta = -26 degrees

So I said the final velocity = 14 m/s East 26 degrees South

"Rod structural bending failure - hand calcsThis a pretty specific problem, not a hw problem but just theoretical (kind of connected to a personal project). Not sure if it fits here, but I'll try. Sorry for the poor formatting, done from mobile.

I just did hand calcs for theoretical bending failure of an aluminum rod, and I'm just looking to double check believing my results match reality.

So the parameters of the problem in question:
A 1/4"" Al-6360 rod supporting a 1lb load 1m away.

Made some simplifications to get:

F = 1 lbf ~= **5N**

L = **1m**

r (radius of rod) = 1/8in = **3.175E-3m**

Tensile yield strength = **214MPa**


---------------------------
So, my calculations:

M = L x F = **5 Nm**

I = (pi x r^4 ) / 4 = **7.981E-11 m^4**

Max bending stress = (M x r)/I = **199MPa**

So, what I get from these calculations is that an approximately 1 lb mass at a 1m cantilever distance from the mounting point will cause a 1/4"" Al rod to approach permanent deformation.

I know the question seems pretty random, but I haven't done much applied structural analysis in the past, so I chose numbers like 1 lb and 1 m that I can easily estimate in reality. So, are my calculations and conclusion correct?",1

"Change in the content of a solution based on influx - calculate content of the influx?Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the rather unhelpful title - I'm currently working on a metabolism model as part of a research project, however, hit a problem I am not really capable of solving on my own.

I am measuring the ratio of a set of compounds (A, B and C) in a solution at different time points. The absolute concentration of all of those compounds increases over time due to a constant influx - what I am interested in is what the ratio is in the influx, if that makes sense? The ratio in the influx will start at 100% A, and change over time to a constant, but different ratio - we assume that the majority of our time points captures this stable phase. 

To add a bit more information, what I am looking at are not different compounds, but different versions of the same compounds, differing only in their isotopic composition. The alternative to this approach would be to fully quantitate the different compounds in the influx, but I am somewhat worried about the reliability of this approach in our case.

"Year 12 Physics Advice/Tips/Important formulas/Anything I may be missing on motion?With physics in school, I'm currently doing a sac. The sac involves two parts, each part relating to a single practical experiment. 

The first experiment was basically a string attached to two masses, a 50g cork on one side, and a 50g weight hanger on the other. A tube with a paper clip was attached to a known radius of the string. It then involved spinning the upper part of the string with the cork, horizontal motion. Then the amount of time for 30 revolutions, and after that adding more weight to the hanger and repeating.

I already did the first part of the sac, don't think I did well. I had to calculate centrifugal force, had no idea how to get the velocity but on my paper it said g=9.8m/s/s, so I used gravity as acceleration to calculate velocity. (which I have the feeling wasn't correct) T (period) and frequency also had to be calculated. I divided 30 by the amount of time it took for T, and then divided from 1 for frequency. Those results had to then be showed in a centrifugal force vs frequency graph, with questions like what did the results show between fc and freq, (I simply wrote freq decreases as fc increases or something like that) were the disrepancies in results and why (unanswered) and I think something about tension? A second graph had to be drawn showing fc and freq^2 and a couple more questions for that one. 

I'm feeling I'm at risk of failing, so I want to get prepared for the next part as much as possible. The 2nd prac involved a ramp in 
which a marble was put on to fall down. The time it took for the marble to hit the ground, and a general measure of where it landed were recorded.

1a) A proton is at rest in laboratory reference frame S with rest mass 938 MeV/c2. How much energy is required to accelerate it to 95% the speed of light (0.95c)?

I solved this question and obtained an answer of T = 2066 MeV/c2 (the extra kinetic energy) My issue is with the second problem.

1b) A large nucleus with rest mass M = 14700 MeV/c2 is at rest in laboratory frame S. The proton collides with the nucleus and

To do this I know that I have to use momentum 4-vectors and use conservation of momentum in order to get the final velocity. I am trying to use the conservation of total momenta:

(P + Q)\^2 = (P’ + Q’)\^2

where P, Q and P’, Q’ are the momentum 4-vecotrs before and after the collision respectively. The initial 4-vectors are: P = m(c, v), Q = M(c, 0). I think the final ones would be, P’ = 0 (since the proton is part of the nucleus) and Q = M\*(c, u) where M\* = m + M and u is the velocity of the new nucleus. I only obtain 1.2461c which obviously isn’t possible. Here’s where I’m stuck

"Pumping water using weights.Hello there! My father is wanting to implement a grey water system into our house using rain water for toilet use in a supplemental way instead of completely relying on fresh city water which is wasteful. But he doesn't want to add something onto the house two stories up to collect the water, so he wants to elect to capture the water on the ground and pump it up to a holding tank in a room on the second floor. The thing is is that he doesn't want to use an electric pump or carry it up himself, so he got this idea of capturing the water in a large bladder set in a box and then setting a heavy weight on the box lid, using gravity to push the water up where he wants it to be. The unfortunate thing is is that neither of us know the math involved to determine how heavy of a weight is needed for what circumstances.   


For ease of explanation, I've come up with these simple variables to help us determine what we would need to look into:  


The box is 2 meters cubed.   
The hose has a diameter of 2 millimeters and is cylindrical in shape.   
The hose would have to go up 4 meters, the starting point of which is directly on the ground.   
The water is contained in an airtight bladder that fits perfectly to the volume of the box.   
The lid fits perfectly to the sides of the box and for the purposes of this question, has no weight.  
A weight must be placed on the lid and must be able to make the lid touch the bottom of the box.   


How heavy should the weight be? What equations would be needed to determine this for all future configurations of this experiment?",1

"How common is it to have publications as an undergrad?Hello r/askphysics! 

I’m an undergraduate physics student, and just got my first research position this summer. As the title states, I’m wondering how common it is for physics undergrads to have publications under their belts when applying for grad school.


I ask because I’m slowly understanding how much work goes into getting publishable results. We don’t even know if the results will be publishable yet, and in the best case scenario where they are, writing a paper will take a *long* time. Especially since I would be writing it during the semester while taking classes, and it’s only me and my PI working on this project.


I’m freaking out a little because when browsing subreddits about grad admissions, some people are like “oh yeah, I have three publications, one first author” and etc. If one project takes like two years, that just doesn’t seem feasible to me??

"Is this a good explanation of where the energy is fission and fusion comes from?Howdy all, 

I have tried to conceptualize the fission/fusiion process for a long time and have struggled with the traditional binding energy curve explanation you get in textbooks. The below is what Icame up with...does it seem accurate/correct to you?

-----------------

I’m sure you have heard of Albert Einstein’s famous equation E=MC2; you may have even known it was related to nuclear engineering but not known how. What this equation means is that mass is related to energy and energy is related to mass and that it is possible for one to be expressed as the other.


For example as subatomic particles accelerate close to the speed of light (high energy) their mass actually increases tremendously as a direct result of the energy the particle has. That is why particle accelerators (think CERN) have to be so massive to get that extra little push in speed for such tiny particles. (Sadly it is also why we will never be able to travel as fast as light. (Although bending space to effectively go faster than light may be possible.) Energy can be measured as mass and mass can be measured as energy interchangeably. In a loose sense, one can think of energy as having mass.


Okay, now this next part is probably the most intense part of the book, but it is crucial so please read carefully!


It may seem counterintuitive, however the sum of the individual parts of an atom always weigh slightly more than the complete bounded atom. Thus, counter to the old addage, atoms “weigh less than the sum of their parts”. The reason for this is because individual unbound nucleons floating in space have a potential energy with respect to every other nucleon or nucleus created by the strong nuclear force. When nucleons are separated and unbound it is like a ball floating in the air. The ball has potential energy due to gravity compared to the surface of the earth. When the ball falls to the ground it looses that energy just as a nucleon looses energy when it “falls” into and binds with another nucleon or nucleus. 


According to the laws of energy conservation you probably leanred in high school physics, energy must be released in order for there to be an inelastic colission (i.e. where the two objects stick together). For example, two clumps of clay will deform or a falling plate will shatter and make noise. The potential energy has to be disipaited somehow or else the object cannot stay at the lower energy state and will rebound to some degree. The same is true for unbound nucleons. The energy from the binding must be released since the nucleons are going from a higher unbound energy state to a lower bound energy state. As shown with E=MC2 discussed above, that change in energy is reflected as a change in mass known as the “mass deficit” or “binding energy”, the amount of energy released by forming the atom. What is incredible is that this change in mass is real and actually measurable. 


This explains why energy is released when smaller nuclei are fused together in the fusion process. Two smaller unbound nuclei are fused together and release the stored potential energy between them in the process. 

Now at this point you may be wondering how it is possible that putting smaller nuclei together can release energy in the fusion process but breaking apart large nuclei into smaller components can also release energy in the fission process. In actuality, putting smaller parts together always releases energy even in the case of larger nuclei. However, unlike smaller nuclei in the fusion process, the large nuclei involved in nuclear fission have a tremendous amount of potential energy resulting from the electromagnetic repulsion of the protons in the nucleus. When energy is put back into the system via a high energy neutron, the nucleus deforms to the point where the strong force is no longer strong enough to hold the atoms together and the atom explodes due to the electrostatic repulsion caused by the protons. 


In a sense, in fission the energy is the result of the released electrostatic repulsion of the protons (i.e. electrostatic force), whereas in fusion the energy released is due to the loss of potential energy between unbound nucleons (i.e. a result of the strong nuclear force). Just as in the fusion process, uranium atoms also released energy when they were formed eons ago in the center of a star, however that is not what is being harvested in the fission process. 


This explains why so much more energy is released by fusion as oppossed to fission. The nuclear strong force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force (as discussed earlier this is why atoms stay together) so releasing potential energy between nucleons due to binding releases MUCH more energy than that which is released when at large atom explodes due to stored electrostatic repulsion caused by protons.",1

"What was wrong with my thought process? (I dont need you to explain me the math, just the logic) 

I dont need you to explain me how to solve the following question, because I I already know that I can use the X - Xo = Vot + (at\^2)/2 formula to solve it; my problem is that I dont know why I can't use a=ΔV/Δt instead. So, to the question:

""An object moving with uniform acceleration has a velocity of 12.0 cm/s in the positive x direction when its x coordinate is 3.00 cm. If its x coordinate 2.00 s later is 5.00 cm, what is its acceleration?""

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, my thought process was: if the acceleration is equal to ΔV/Δt, then I need to find the second velocity (the first is given, which is 12cm/s). So, I tried to find the second velocity by doing V=ΔS/Δt, which is = 5-3/2-0, which ended up being 2/2, which was equal to 1cm/s. Once I found that, I tried to find the acceleration by doing a=ΔV/Δt. The first acceleration is 12m/s and the last was 1m/s, and the time was 2 seconds. So I did a= 1-12/2-0, therefore a= -5,5m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer, however, is -11m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200B;

So what was wrong in my thought process? Is it because if a is constant, then I must assume that it is not equal to ΔV/Δt ? If so, why is that? If not that, Is it because a=ΔV/Δt means only average acceleration and I must assume that if a is constant, then it must be instantaneous acceleration? If so, why? (Lol, sorry for the bunch of questions.).

&amp;#x200B;

Also, can I, instead of giving that answer, just maintain what I did, and just change it at the end, putting a= 1-12 = -11cm/s\^2 instead of a= 1-12/2-0? If so, is it because Im supposed to ignore the time somehow or what? And if thats the case, why is that?

"Difference between the (Strong) Equivalence Principle and the General Principle of Relativity.I’ve been trying to teach myself some General Relativity (the only time I saw it in university was in a catch-all field theory course) and I’ve been wondering about these two principles:

Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP): local test physics is not affected by the presence of a gravitational field.

General Principle of Relativity (GPR): the fundamental laws of physics are the same in all frames of reference.

I’m having a bit of a hard time understanding the distinction between the two. My current interpretation of the matter is:

SEP is saying that you can “pretend” your frame of reference is subject to fictitious forces (thinking in classical terms) arising from the fact that it is non-inertial (hence the need for locality, because fictitious acceleration would be constant throughout space).

GPR is saying that you can explain all fictitious forces as gravitational fields, which seems to be an equivalent statement to the previous.

"Destructive vs Constructive Interference QuestionQ: What is the thinnest film (but not zero) that produces a strong reflection for green light with a wavelength of 500 nm ?

A pulse of frequency *f* (MHz) is emitted into a material with attenuation coefficient *a* (dB/cm/MHz). If the pulse travels a distance *d* (cm) then I have to find the loss.

The answer finds it simply by saying that loss = *a\*f\*d* (dB).

Sure the units work out, but shouldn't we use the equations for loss and intensity? Equations :

*loss* (dB) *= 10\*Log(I / I\_0)* where *I / I\_0 =  exp(-μ\*d)*

I presumed that *μ* (dB/cm) = *a* (dB/cm/MHz) *\* f* (MHz) because the exponential must have units of dB

I will be a junior this fall, but I decided to change my major to chemistry this past semester (from a non-science major) as I developed an interest in understanding more about how the world works. I took calculus I and general chemistry I, and am currently taking general chemistry II as a summer class.

I find chemistry fascinating and enjoy understanding how matter interacts and changes form. Yet, I noticed that I am more drawn to the areas of chemistry that share more in common with physics, such as electrochemistry, nuclear chemistry, and thermodynamics. I like that physics encompasses more than the scope of chemistry, including topics like mechanics, optics, and electricity and magnetism. I also enjoy the fundamentals of physics concepts and how they explain natural phenomenon. I like mathematics and would enjoy the challenge of applying calculus to solve physics problems.

I am considering either a degree in chemistry, with a physical chemistry concentration, or a degree in physics. (I would graduate a year later than originally intended if I chose to change to physics.) I know there is a lot of overlap between the two, and I have not decided which path I am more interested in pursuing.

"Can I get some help understanding spacetime and velocity as relating to the 2nd law of thermodynamics?So as I understand it (at least in the Minkowski model), we are always moving at the speed of light through spacetime. If you increase your velocity through space, you decrease your velocity through time. Because of this, if you move 2 clocks through space, one significantly faster than the other, then when you bring them back together, it turns out that the clock that moved faster is a little behind the other. Motion relativity effects between objects moving significantly slower than the speed of light, then, are pretty much just another layer of relativity on top of this. In addition, the speed of light is a universal speed limit. But, theoretically, if you COULD move faster than light, you'd be reversing causality or going backward in time in some way, or something along those lines. These are my assumptions coming in to this.

Anyway, this brings me to my questions.

First, if it's impossible for an ""object"" (you know, like, something that's not a wave/particle with a velocity of c) to actually achieve the speed of light in space, does that mean the same object also can not fully stop moving? There's probably a temptation here to respond by saying ""stop moving relative to what?"" So to clarify, I mean stop moving in the sense that your velocity ""on the space axis"" in the Minkowski model is zero. The reason I ask is that if it's impossible to achieve zero on the time axis and c on the space axis, shouldn't it also be impossible to achieve zero on the space axis and c on the time axis? And if it IS possible to stop moving on the space axis, why is that? (given that you can't stop moving on the time axis)

Then the second question is this: Whenever I ask the internet, ""why does time only move forward"" or ""why do objects all move the same direction through time"" or some variation on that question, the answer always seems to be ""because the 2nd law of thermodynamics dictates that the universe must move from a more ordered state to a state of more entropy, therefore you can't unmix a cup of coffee and milk."" But this seems to me to be a truism, or in other words, an answer that doesn't do anything more than describe the question in a different way. It just begs the new question, why does everything move from order to chaos? If we go back to the Minkowski model, it would seem that in a universe moving toward a state of total entropy, all objects would simply be reducing their velocity on the space axis and increasing their velocity on the time axis. So I find myself unable to conceptualize any actual relationship between entropy and time at all. Is there actually a relationship there I don't understand? Or can somebody explain why everything seems to move forward in time without using the 2nd law of thermodynamics as an answer?",1

"Infinite Mass but Finite Gravitational ForceHello I came up with this scenario which seems to be a bit strange. Suppose you had a mass of M = 1 kg at the origin. Then at 1 meter you have a mass m1 = 1 kg then at 2 meters you have a mass of m2 = 1 kg  then at 3 meters you have m3 = 1kg ..... which goes on forever. So the net force on M is G/1^2 + G/2^2 + G/3^2 + G/4^2 .......  which is G * the sum of 1/r^2 from 1 to infinity which is G * (pi^2) /6 so there is a finite gravitational force on M even though there is infinite mass. Similar argument shows that any mass to the right of M experiences a finite gravitational force (just add up the left side and for the right side it is just the infinite sum minus the left side terms) 
My question is as this system evolves over time will the gravitational  force eventually be infinite at any point or approach infinity at any point.

"M40 Max height based on Compression Strength limits?If I want to build a wall out of pure M40 concrete, what's the highest I can build it, purely based on compression strength limits? 

Not a homework problem, I want to know how high my wall can be for DND(more or less).

&amp;#x200B;

M40 has a compression strength 4\*10\^7 N/m\^2 and a density of 2500kg/m\^3

I set them equal, substituting 9.8kg for 1N and multiplying density by variable z to find height

4\*10\^7\*9.8kg/(m\^2) = 2500kg/(m\^3)z

I got z = 1632.65m

Wouldn't the light object being used to hit the heavier object be able to compensate for its low mass by going much faster?

Currently, I am able to throw a ball and have it fly in an arch according to its initial force and gravity. Next, I want to make the balls bounce off the ground.

I know the ball's mass, velocity, and net force (with velocity and net force being represented by three dimensional vectors). Also, if the materials of the ball and floor are a part of that equation, I can set them to whatever I want; for now, let's assume a rubber ball and concrete floor.

for the asteroid with mass m0 (0,0,0,0)

for the asteroid with mass m moving in +ve x: (E1/c, mv1y1,0,0)

for the asteroid with mass m moving in -ve x: (E2/c, -mv2y2,0,0)

(E1/c , Mv * y * cos(theta), M v * y * sin(theta),0,0)

(E2/c, Mv * y * cos(theta), -Mv * y * sin(theta),0,0)

This seems fine, they'll both have the same gamma factor moving with the same v, so they have the same y above. The cosine components are the same, but the sin components are opposite signed.

For part ii) I can't figure out how to get this result, if I equate the x-components, I 

1) get a factor of cosine which i can't get rid of

2) get v1 and v2 in the expression 

3) cant use m0 straight away because initially m0 has no momentum

part iii) and iv) are easy enough because I can just use the expression given, but part ii) makes me think I got my 4-vectors wrong?

"Am I on the right track?[ problem asks us to justify why the force F1 has to be greater than F2 for the velocity of the box to be constant, assuming friction with respect to the floor is equal in both situations and the masses of the boxes are same. My reasoning is: in the first situation, the effective force pushing the box forward is trivially equal to F1\*cos(alpha), but it is also acting with a force of F1\*sin(alpha) on the ground, so friction is stronger. There is no such force in the second situation, therefore F1 &gt; F2. Is it correct?",1

"What was the most difficult subject for you during the undergraduate?Just out of curiosity.

There are four main subjects when it comes to physics curriculum..

&amp;#x200B;

Classical mechanics, Electrodynamics, Statistical mechanics, Quantum mechanics.

&amp;#x200B;

Among the four of them I found Statistical mechanics(or, equivalently, thermal physics) to be the hardest one. I actually didn't know why I had to derive Maxwell's identity, Free energy, Gibbs free energy, and something else. So many variables that I'm not sure which variable to choose to describe which system. I think it can depend on what textbook is used during the curriculum.

&amp;#x200B;

I used Marion and Thornton for CM(5th edition) during the second year. I should have grasped thorough knowledge of Linear algebra by the time I went through Moment of inertia. I didn't know why I had to get eigenvalues of the tensor back then. But this is a clearly a good book cause it helps to connect classical concepts to quantum mechanics and contains a lot of great problems too.

&amp;#x200B;

Griffiths for EM. It was really helpful to understand how to use vector analysis / calculus. And quite a lot of good problems from the easiest ones to challenging ones. Clear explanation. I also found Wangsness's EM was really great too. I used it as a reference cause Griffiths didn't get deep down in certain topics. Wangsness basically covers everything to prepare you for Jackson.

&amp;#x200B;

Griffiths for QM, which I think is a horrible choice as opposed to EM. But still okay(so so) book.

"Physics Help A man paddles a canoe in a long, straight section of a river. The canoe moves downstream with constant speed 3 m/s relative to the water.

"Is it possible to not ""move"" through space?*Background: *

Earlier this morning I over heard some random dad explain to his 8-10'ish year old kid that we live on a planet that moves around the sun in our solar system, that itself, is orbiting in a galaxy, where that galaxy itself is also moving and blah blah blah... You probably can guess the rest.

But the kid's reply was golden I think. He said he that he was worried if the Earth doesn't stay still that his house might not get wifi any more. 

Ignore his understanding of wifi and other stuff for a second, because he did say something that's been bugging me all day. This is what leads me to try and ask you guys these two following questions.

*Actual Question 1: *

Is it possible to pick out a point in space and never move from that point/spot?

B.) Not moving from your point of origin?

C.) This question does not make sense because you'd need to be located relative from some other ""thing"" in order to have a point of origin?",1

"Moving a MermaidI'm no physicist or someone looking to become one. I just have a physics puzzle in front of me and I don't know what to google to answer the question for myself. 

For context, I'm a theatre student who is working on a performance project. I've been really inspired by mermaids recently (thank you #Mermay) and had the fleeting idea of how much of a statement it would be to be wheeled onstage submerged in a large container of water, and then ""gasp"" out, emerging with all the grace of a dying fish. Art. But I'm well aware of how impractical that would probably turn out to be in rolling out a container strong enough and large enough to hold me and however much water. Still, it was a fun visual.

That did get me curious though. From what I understand, buoyancy helps reduce the amount of force needed to move an object through water. But does that reduction of work matter at all if you're also moving the water?

For instance, say a neutrally-buoyant ball (or is it more fun to imagine a mermaid?) weighs x grams, and a bucket of water weights y grams. Ifyou put that ball into the bucket of water and then apply force to the side of the bucket, do you have to apply as much force as it would take to move those two weights, x and y, cuminatively? Or does the buoyancy of the ball help reduce the amount of energy needed at all? Does the answer change if the ball is more negatively or more positively bouyant?

"How do you approach your studies?I suppose this is more of a ""meta"" question rather than a specific physics problem, but I hope it can still have a place here and maybe let me come away with some helpful tips.

I'm having a really hard time studying physics (undergraduate, 4th semester) because it feels so incredibly unrewarding to do so. This issue is not helped by the fact that I do not have any physics related end goal, that physics degree is just going to serve as insurance for a very distant period of my life where I will settle down and my objectives change. For now, I just wish I could do something else. Now that I've managed to come this far I should get this thing over the finish line, though.

So that's why I am here. I want to find out how you guys approach studying and how do you set yourself goals that feel achievable and rewarding on a short-term basis? I am currently tackling quantum mechanics and I've never felt so unsatisfied. I chose to study physics because I'm curious about how things work. But at university level that doesn't come easily. When I read a script or book, I understand nothing on the deepest level. In order to truly grasp it in its entirety I would sit for hours on a single page, looking up and understand the concept behind every single word that I didn't know and re-calculating every equation to fully understand the steps from start to finish. And then I finally feel like having a crack at the problem set and realize I get none of it. Fantastic! Now I don't put in the effort to do this. Feeling like an idiot and working hard for an entire day just to maybe at the end of it come out being a tiny step closer to understanding some part of physics sucks really damn hard.

Is this really how responsible, hard working students approach their studies? In that case I'm in the wrong place. I mean, in that case it's also kinda cool that I came so far with my pathetic work ethic, but surely there must be ways to make studying feel more meaningful and rewarding on a short-term scale. When I work for an hour my brain goes ""Ding! Another hour completed, money in the bank."", when I study physics for an hour my brain goes ""What is this crap? Oh man, I thought I'm smart. I actually know nothing. Knowing anything would require lifetime devotion to the subject. Get me out of here!"".

"UCSB or UCI for undergraduate Physics?I just finished my second year as a physics major at a UC and I’ve been accepted to UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara for Physics as a third year transfer. I’m having a tough choice between the two universities and TLDR I just feel that academically, UCSB would be the better choice but I would enjoy being at UCI more. 

I want to go to grad school when I finish my Bachelors at one of these two schools so I know that research opportunity is a big factor when I comes to being a strong applicant. Currently I have 0 research experience (yeah I’m behind) but academically I’ve been at the top of my classes (have good relationships with all my physics professors so far  I would say and have asked for letters of rec) and have a 3.8 GPA so I would say if I add in some research experience within these two upcoming years, I would have really good chances of getting into a top school. 
I’m not sure which specific area of physics yet, but I’m hoping I would be certain on one soon.

So I know that UCSB is known to have one of the best physics programs (#2 public university in CA, right behind UCB) so UCSB is pretty respected among the “physics world.” I know that UCI has a great physics program as well, but when it comes down to it, does the undergrad university matter? Do grad schools take it as a huge factor when considering an applicant? I heard that students in the College of Creative Studies have high chances of getting into a good grad school because they are well prepped, so I was looking forward to the program. However, I also heard that they don’t care much for transfer students and it’s hard for transfer students to be admitted into CCS. Does anybody have more info on this?

I visited both UCSB and UCI this week and here’s what I thought of it (please don’t think I’m disrespecting either campus because both are really good campuses and this is just my personal take on it)

When I first got to UCSB, I saw a lot of people walking around and immediately saw the chill vibe of the area. But I don’t like the surrounding college town, Isla Vista. I’ve heard about how the landlords are super bad and the housing is overpriced for the small space you get. Don’t get me wrong, I’m into the party scene but it’s just not a big factor I feel like I need. I’m more into partying with friends rather than huge blowouts with strangers. The reason I don’t like it is because it’s pretty messy and dirty. I like working from home and a clean working space is a high priority to me. I envy the students here who are able to balance everything but I feel that if I try hard enough I can get it done as well. I also feel like the buildings are a bit old but the campus overall is alright. However, the building for the College of Creative Studies is a run down yellow box and the the building that says Physics on it (I think it’s offices and labs for grad students) looks like a jail inside. But other than that, the modern side of the library, the Physical Science building and the Engineering buildings are beautiful. I also know that UCSB has the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics but as an undergrad does that matter much?(Aside from sitting in on seminars from physicists that are here for that resource of course). The side by the Lagoon is also beautiful and I really liked it. Another thing I liked was that the beach is next to the school so I can see why a lot of people says UCSB is gorgeous. I’m not a big fan of downtown as well. It’s an okay city with some alright food places but I personally love Asian cuisine and I didn’t find any great boba or pho/noodle spots (I’m sure there are some outside of Goleta).

When I first got to UCI I was amazed at how different it is compared to UCSB. It’s almost a complete flip. The nature and beach was swapped for an extremely clean city with not much of a sense of close community like Isla Vista. I thought the campus itself was also okay but what stood out to me was how close everything is. There’s a little plaza with Target, Trader Joe’s, Chick Fil A etc. literally next to campus. Also the park in the middle of campus seems like a peaceful area (I didn’t like how hilly the inner campus is though). The best thing about going to UCI is that one of my close friends who goes there right now is looking for a housemate for a house 10 min walking distance from campus (so I don’t have to worry about housing). I also know a lot of people who go there but I don’t think this is a big deal because college is about making new friends and forming new connections. But I feel that it should be said because that’s why I’m more certain I will have a better time at UCI. Another big thing is that LA and SD is 1-2hrs away + more food areas. The down sides are that the party life, nightlife, and the physics isn’t as strong as compared to UCSB. However my intuition led me to think this: UCI is still a research university with a lot of resources related to physics. Wouldn’t it be easier to gain research experience here compared to UCSB since not many come to UCI for the physics major? Idk just a thought, might be wrong. 

I think the biggest factors influencing my decision are: how well I think i will do in academics, how much research i can get done, and how much I will enjoy the overall experience. Please comment and share any insight you have in what I should take account of or any advice in general!",1

We solved for m so we can say that weight = PLG now we need the normal component that the table exerts this is where i'm running into a little bit of an issue I want to say the the normal force (N) will just be the weight of the snake plus some constant velocity but i'm not entirely sure how I would express this.",1

"What is affected by a magnetic field?Dear Physicians of Reddit, I have a little question!

Firstly, sorry for my ignorance, I just graduated high-school and my knowledge in physics is limited to the very basic level of a few subjects that I've learned in school.

So I've finished high-school physics about a week ago and one of the subjects were electromagnetism. We learned about the magnetic field, how it's created and how it affects charged particles or any electric current (Which is obviously many charged particles, so it makes sense).

I know one definition of a field (electric, magnetic, gravitational,  ETC), which is that if you're in the field and you fit a certain requirement (have a mass for gravitational, have a charge for electric, and have a moving charge(?) for magnetic) it applies force on you (We learned Newtonian physics so force is a key word).

The thing is, I know that magnetic fields don't only apply force on moving charged particles, as they affect most metals, so what is the requirement for a magnetic field to apply force on you (apart from moving charge)?

I've tried googling this but weirdly didn't find any answers, I'm sure that I just haven't dug far enough, but I'm sure that a personal answer to my question will be the most effective!

"What do physicists mean when they say “if the Big Bang is the beginning of time, then...”?This question is coming from someone who is a complete newbie to physics, so please excuse any errors or mistakes because I am relying on the knowledge that I’ve acquired in school. 

According to Wikipedia, time in physics is defined by its measurement; it is what a clock reads. 

Now... a clock reads based on counting the number of occurrences of some repetitive change. So is time the same as change? So when they say “the beginning of time”, they mean “the beginning of change”? 

What conditions are required for the non-existence of time to be physically possible? 

Aside question: I often hear that the singularity was dense and hot with no atoms or structure. But why is it dense when the definition of density is mass/volume. If a thing has no atoms, how can it have a mass? As far as I know, protons and neutrons are what gives the atom its mass. So, the singularity had protons and neutrons, but these protons and neutrons weren’t structured into an atom? Finally, what does ‘no structure’ mean in this context?",1

Because when they get pushed they start colliding with each other, so that makes them warmer but there is so much air and surface of the truck that it radiates away. So could it be that the kinetic energy that the birds exert on the air in order to stay up, transforms to heat energy and then it gets radiated out, and by the time it reaches the truck floor is nothing left?

"I tried to calculate the distance to the alien's homeworld (and the acceleration of their ships) in ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke. Did I do this right? If so, how can I get more information?The alien race in Childhood's End are called ""The Overlords,"" and at various points throughout the book he gives hints regarding their location and technology.  He mentions early on that their ships take ""about an hour"" to reach maximum acceleration,  the Overlords ""would age only four months on the round trip [from their planet to Earth], but when they returned their friends would be eighty years older.""

So to get the average velocity on the round trip, I would need:

t = t0 / (sqrt (1 - (v/c)^2))

4 months = 1.051 *10^7 seconds.
80 years = 2.523 * 10^9 seconds.

Solve for v:

2.523 * 10^9 seconds = 1.051 *10^7 seconds / (sqrt (1-(v/c)^2)

(1.051 *10^7 seconds/ 2.523 * 10^9 seconds)^2 = 1 - (v/c)^2

1.735*10^(-5) + (v/c)^2 = 1

(v/c) = sqrt (1-1.735*10^(-5) ) = 0.999991325

v = (0.99999132496) * (299 792 458 m / s) = 299,789,857 m/s average velocity.

299,789,857 m/s  * (80 years in seconds) = 7.585*10^17 meters = 80.17 light years (round trip)

Hence, the Overlords' planet is ~40.085 light years away (supposedly in the constellation Carina).


It supposedly took the Overlords ""about an hour"" to accelerate their ships to these speeds (g-force compensators were mentioned).  The simple way to do this would simply be to divide the speed of light by an hour and call that a rough approximation of the acceleration.

HOWEVER, the ""about an hour"" figure comes from the time measured *on the spaceship*.  Up until this point, this was all stuff I learned in high school and I'm a bit rusty.  But I genuinely don't know how to determine how long it took them to accelerate from the perspective on a stationary observer.

"Emf graph of conducting rod moving through a constant magnetic field.Hi, I have a question that I need clarification with.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say I have a conducting rod that is entering a magnetic field at some velocity v. I know that a positive charge in the rod moving through a magnetic field will experience a force. So the distribution of positive charges will shift to one side and the imbalanced charge distribution will induce an emf through the rod, having one end of the rod more negatively charged than the other at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: as the rod moves into the magnetic field, there will be cutting of magnetic field lines. Could I possibly use Faraday's law to say that magnetic flux linkage increases, inducing an emf that will oppose the rod's movement into the magnetic field?

&amp;#x200B;

Is a concept like magnetic flux linkage only used for closed loops and not rods? Technically, while rods don't have a number of turns, it does have an area perpendicular to the magnetic field...

&amp;#x200B;

How would the emf graph induced look like? Would it be very small as it enters the magnetic field due to Faraday's law and then increase rapidly once the rod is completely inside the field as there no more change in magnetic flux? Or am I getting some concepts wrong completely?

"Water from the air concept – plausible?Here’s an idea I had:

Consider how a rocket stove works..

There is an inlet where wood is fed into the stove and an outlet for which the exhaust can vent. Very simple but very effective.

Now apply that idea toward a water collection device: 

Instead of using fire and wood use a heating element or alternatively you could use a fresnel lense heating a metal surface with focused concentrated sunlight.

The hot air would rise out the outlet of the stove and I believe this would draw in air into the inlet of the stove. Not sure whether a constriction at the top of the outlet would be ideal to create a pressurized release of heated air that may draw in even more air into the inlet or whether that would lessen the ability.

Zeolite rocks could be placed into where the wood would normally be stacked such that the air would be drawn through the porous material. This would cause the water to bead up and accumulate. You could make a drip pan to divert the water off into a container at that point. 

So my question is:

With wood burning stoves and rocket stoves, there is a lot of air drawn into the stove and often in a lot of airflow (several CFM.) 

Is this condition possible to recreate absent consumables? Could just heating the air make this possible? I know that smoke and the various release of different hydrocarbons have more mass then air alone so that would create more of a draft. Also when fire burns it consumes the oxygen in the air. 

The ideal condition is to have a high rate of airflow going through the device so that water in the air will accumulate in the zeolite and be harvested. With heating air alone in the above described arrangement (absent consumables) is this possible to create a high rate of airflow?",1

First, I found the initial speed of the marble with a = v\^2/r, so speed = sqrt(a\*r), so sqrt(2\*0,8), which is roughly 1,265. Then, I found the speed after one rotation with 2\*pi\*r / period, so 2\*pi\*0.8/4, which is roughly 1.257 m/s.

With this, I found the acceleration between the two with final speed\^2 = initial speed\^2 + 2\*a\*x.

"What causes time dilation?I know that time dilation occurs because the speed of light must always be constant, but is there any physical cause for time dilation? 

Take simultaneity for example, using a lattice you can physically show how events aren't simultaneous for different observers by shifting the lattice for a observer with a certain velocity. But time dilation from what I've learned just 'happens', time slows down, that's it. Is there anything physically causing time to slow down?",1

"Relativistic kinematics problemA large marble mass M is at rest initially. Now we start shooting small marbles with mass m0 at it, always in the same direction, with speed v0.

"What would a ship travelling near light speed look like?Imagine two observers, one on Earth and one on a ship travelling 0.99c on a ship. From the observer on the ship, the Earth is length contracted and time passes faster, since time is dilated on the ship, 1 second for him may be 10 seconds on Earth. If he had a strong enough telescope, everyone would be walking around quite fast.


So, to the observer on Earth, time must be much slower for the observer and the ship (1 second passes for every 10 on Earth). Does this mean he sees the ship actually travel slower, as time is dilated, or does he still see it travel at 0.99c?",1

"Need Advice on E&amp;MOkay so I've been trying to solve questions from Purcell &amp; Morin Electrodynamics. But the problem is that I can't. 70% of the time I have to look at the solutions.

Similar is the case with DJ Griffith when I tried to do it 5-6 months ago. Every time I miss some little detail that is crucial for the solution. After spending some 15-20 minutes on a question I turn to the  back of the book and read the solution. It is so elegantly and beautifully solved, it makes me feel like a cheater at times. I have tried using the common tips on problem solving: 1. Read the questions carefully, 2. Identify what is given and being asked, 3.Apply the first principle method, etc...

Some might say that I am just not smart enough. But I don't think that's the case. Around 4 years ago, I cracked the IIT Engineering exam(if you are an Indian you know it's the toughest) by studying for only 6-7 months whereas most of the students can't even while studying for 2 years. I was able to solve E&amp;M questions at that time. Calculus was not a problem either. I am sorry if it feels like I'm boasting.

"Question concerning a (hydrogen/oxygen) fuel cell/ electrolytic cell setup.Hopefully quick question: If I connect a fuel cell to an electrolytic cell, placing the fuel cell above the electrolytic cell, and decide to convert some of the potential energy of the water into electricity as it flows down (back into the electrolytic cell) (with, say, a turbine(s) ), the later should scale with the height difference between the two, right?

I'm certain it's impossible to just ""build higher"" until achieving a net gain (as far as the in/output of electrical energy is concerned), but I don't know enough about the related processes to be able to tell why, and that's been bugging me. (Honestly I'm not sure even sure if this is more of a chemistry question....)

Specifically: Can the setup theoretically be freely scaled in height, if no, why, and if yes, which of the processes lose(s) in efficiency/ unit mass to compensate for the increased yield of the turbine?

"RG flows: Callan-Simanzyk vs. WilsonSay I got myself my favourite QFT in d dim. I can do two things: 1, compute loop diagrams like there is no tomorrow, regularize, renormalize (say dim-reg + MS bar), and I find my beta functions “a la C-S”. Or 2, write the path integral, coarse-grain integrating out momentum shells, and find my beta functions “a la W”. In both cases I’m looking at how the couplings change with the energy scale, so they should give the same thing, morally speaking.

Here come the questions:

- Are they really the same thing? I seem to recall from the back of my mind that there was some issue with massless fields, but I cannot find where I read it, or any place where they discuss these things for that matter.

- Does scheme dependence play a role in the story?

- In particular, take QED in 2+1d. All 1PI diagrams are finite, which would mean that the beta functions are zero “a la C-S”, but they definitely are not “a la W”. It confuses me.

"Designing a game level around 4th dimension. Are my ideas theoretically valid?Hello, as the title says I'm designing a small map themed around the 4th dimension. There sure will be some scifi mixed in but I'd like to validate my ideas before I proceed to create something that defies the real world physics (or theoretical) completely.


So basically the idea is that humanity discovered this weird area in the universe where higher dimensional objects interrupt with our 3D universe (oddly enough it's only a local phenomena). People studied it and figured out how to ""stabilize"" these objects and built some kind of a 4th dimensional museum/entertainment park around it - that's the map I'm creating.


The way I think about it is with the 2D creature living in flatland analogy. You could crush it/obstruct its' world from your 3D world right? I wanna do kind of the same with the 4th dimension. There's also another part which says 4th dimension is time. I can crudely imagine both explanations separately but they don't quite come together for me. However I'd like to use them both.


The ideas:
I wanna have areas which are ""stabilized"" (safe for 3D creature to explore) and then unstable areas where objects would be popping in and out randomly and could kill you. 
	
* in safe areas, 4D objects could only be observed visually - have no collision or their collision would be locked in place in 3D
	
* tessaract - I wanted to throw the player inside a (hollow) hypercube but I'm unsure if that even makes sense. Basically you would go inside all 6 (8?) of the cubes in tessaracts' 3D projection and then maybe teleport in another projection of it since that's about everything I could think of. Is that reasonable?
	
* in unstable areas there would be randomly killing 4D objects OR a moving timescale where things would go back and forth in time under your legs. XYZ coordinates would stay the same for you, only the time axis would change so you would see objects in the room moving around in time. This would probably be only a visual thing, done by holograms and animations but theoretically if you move yourself on a timescale to a point where there's a collision in your XYZ at the time, you die right?
	
* at the end you would get sucked into a black hole but I have yet to figure that part out

	
Do these ideas make at least a little bit of sense or does it go against physics too much?
Are there any other interesting 4D ideas I could throw in?

"data handling strategies in computational physicsFor the next month or so I will do some numerical analysis on a system. The last time I did anything numerics related was about 4 years ago during my undergraduate studies, where at some point I struggled with having so much data in various files and folders that I couldn't process everything. The biggest problem was that it was all not structured very well and occasionally I would overwrite previous files by accident, because I didn't choose the correct name. I did more or less what was taught to me during a computational physics course: write all parameters you use explicitly in the folder and file names, and each file is just a csv file with a number of columns in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes talk to colleagues and physics friends about this and the majority uses the same strategy: store all your data in hundreds or thousands of files. However, when I talk to my non-physics friends, those that handle data say they have one big data warehouse and then use something like SQL to extract the data they need.

"Physics revolving airplanesI have two questions. And this only regards Newton’s 3 laws and the forces of Lift(Fn), Thrust(Fa), Weight(Fg), And drag(Ff).

i) to takeoff, an airplane must accelerate until its forward speed gives it enough lift to get of the the ground. What are two ways in which the mass of the airplane affects takeoff?

My answer: The weight of the Aircraft affects the lift and the drag of the aircraft. More weight means more thrust needed to accelerate and the force of lift would need to be greater than that of the weight in order for it to properly takeoff.

ii) why is friction greater at lower altitudes?

My answer: Friction is greater at lower altitudes because the air is more dense than that of being at higher altitudes

"Geometry question about finding the radius of the earth based off the sunset over a mountain.So as many of you probably already know, it's extremely easy to find the radius of the earth by watching a sunset over the horizon at two different altitudes, and timing the difference between the two observed sunsets, as seen in this image:

 what Im wondering is there a way to solve for the sunset over a mountain of known height and distance away? Such as in my (shitty) ms paint drawing:  my question is, if you know the height of the mountain, and the height of the observer, and the distance between them, and the angle formed from the sunsets, is it possible to work out a solution to the radius of the earth?

I ask because currently in my lab class I am trying to measure the radius of the earth using sunrise and sunset, and both of those have mountains in the way that are seriously affecting our data.

Assumptions you can make:

The distance between the observer and the mountain is essentially just D, and flat, that is to say you can assume that there is no curvature between them (if this helps). 

The mountain is in the range of 5-10 times the height of the observer,  so it doesn't form a near rectangle or anything.

"[homework] A level -search coil practicalI’m confused with the following practical of finding the max induced emf using a search coil in a magnetic field
 a few things that are confusing me in this practical
1) what formula do you use, do you treat the search coil as rotating coil just very slow and therefore use emf= BAN omega sin theta t 
Or do you use BANcos theta ( now I’m typing this it seems obviously the second one but I’m leaving it in for clarification)

2) what angle am I meant to measure? I presume this is why on one page is saying cos theta while the other sin but I’m not sure. I know  in rotating coils you measure the angle between the normal to the coil and the magnetic field lines. And as emf is max when flux linkage is zero, therefore emf is max when the coil is parallel to field lines therefore the angle the normal makes is 90 which points towards a sin relationship. Is this what’s going on because I don’t really know what angle is what and what’s going on.

""Does this value correspond exactly to a given isotope or does it suggest there may be a mixture of isotopes? If so what other ones might be present and why are they hard to detect with this experiment""

&amp;#x200B;

So basically the this experiment was using a geiger-muller counter to identify the isotope of a copper sample we'd been given. I found the sample had a half life of 6.79 minutes, so then I looked on the above table to find the coressponding value or similar value and found the closest to be 5.12 minutes which is the Cu-66 isotope.

"Is the moon's orbital velocity around earth faster than a satellite at that altitude?Since the equation for orbital velocity takes into account the mass of both bodies, and since the total mass between earth and the moon would be higher than earth and any satellite, I would assume that the moon's velocity would be faster, and therefor it would eventually catch up to and crash into anything you put in the same orbit, right?

"Potential of Concentric Spherical Insulator and ConductorHey everyone,   


[ I'm stuck conceptually on this problem. I have to find the electric potential at various points in this picture (Sphere). The inner circle is uniformly charged, where the outer ring is a uncharged conducting shell.   


I was first asked to find V(b), which is the inner surface of the conductor. This turned out to be V(b)=kQ/c. Is this because the charge on the inner surface is equal to the outer surface?   


The second question asked me for the electric potential on the inner surface of the sphere. I thought this would be V(a)=kQ/a + KQ/c, but that was incorrect. The correct answer was kQ/a +kQ/b - kQ/c. I have no idea how to derive this myself.

"Maximum stress withstood by a grid fin during reentryHello Reddit. I'm currently doing a paper on the materials that can be used to make grid fins but first I have to find what are the stresses that they will have to withstand. I've been searching for a couple of days but I haven't found anything certain. I have tried framing it as a load and sheer force problem but I haven't got any experience in that so I've found it difficult to calculate anything. The data that I have collected is the following:

* The maximum acceleration that the craft experiences is 5.6 g.
* The dimensions of the fin are 1.22 (Width) by 1.524 (Length) by 0.22 (Height) meters.
* The total mass of the rocket (Falcon Heavy centerstage) is 424.6 tonnes, however, the burned fuel changes this to around 30 tonnes.
* At this point, the aerodynamic pressure is of 2.6 kN/m\^2
* The mass of the fin is 100 kg (Not totally sure).
* The diameter of the stage is 3.7 meters (This makes the total cross section cutting right through the fins 3.7+1.524\*2=6.748)

Feel free to make any simplifications that you want, I only need a rough estimate of the stresses that the craft withstand. But I have only gotten values of either 2 or so MPa (Too low to be true, since the aluminum fins suffered a lot and they have around 400 MPa of tensile strength) or 5000 MPa (The titanium fins currently in use wouldn't withstand this load).

"Help building a device that can retrieve an object from waterHello! I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to put this but I’m in desperate need of help for this machine I need to build for an AP Physics 2 class. I have no background in building anything and neither does anyone I know, so I’m totally at a loss. 

So this project requires that I create some sort of retrieval device that can grab a golf ball from the bottom of a large container of water. The container is a trash can with height: 24 in, base diameter: 19 in, opening diameter 19.75 in. 

Here are the rules:

The device must be activated either while floating within the top 6 inches of water or while being held just above the surface of the water 

It must then retrieve a gold ball from the bottom; everything (device and ball) must end up floating within the top 6 inches of the water in the container. (the ball itself does not need to break the surface of the water as long as it is held by the device within the top 6 inches of the water) 

You may only interact with your device once to activate it in the beginning. After that the device must operate on its own. 

The device may not damage the container. 

The device must be self contained. It may not alter the characteristics of the water in the container by dumping sand, chemicals, salt, etc. 

You may not use any live animals as part of your device (lol). 


Again, I am at a complete loss on how to do this. I have never built anything mechanical in my life and I have no idea what I would even do to make this, let alone what materials to buy or how to assemble it. 

If anyone has any ideas for this, or even a youtube video I can watch that will give me a better understanding, then please help!! I’m desperate!",1

"Issue with calculating surface free energyThis might be way too specific, but I'll try my luck. I have trouble understanding the theoretical background of methods calculating surface free energy from measured contact angles and surface tension of the measurement liquid. As far as I understand, they are all based on the Young-Dupré equation which relates the work of adhesion to the contact angle and the liquid's surface tension. This equation is then combined with Berthelot's mixing rule which assumes that the work of adhesion approximately equals the geometric mean of the solid's and the liquid's surface tension. 

This is the point where I don't understand why from there on, different models like Fowkes or Owens &amp; Wendt exist, which devide the surface tension into components. The Young-Dupré equation combined with the rule of geometric already has only one unknown variable left: the solid's surface tension/free energy. So you would just have to measure the contact angle and the liquid's surface tension and could calculate the surface free energy.

Is this not done because the geometric mean rule does not apply to the liquids but only to their components like disperse and polar surface tensions?",1

 It has been suggested that a possible transportation system to connect two cities such as Boston and Washington, D.C., might function like this: Drill a tunnel straight from Boston to Washington. A car released in Boston would fall under the influence of gravity, gaining speed, and then finally coasting back to the surface at Washington. The only expenditure of energy required would be that to overcome friction, and this could be reduced by using an evacuated tunnel or magnetic levitation of the train or other possible techniques. Assuming the density of the earth is constant (it isn't), and using only the value of the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface (9.8 m/s2) and the radius of the earth (6380 km) determine how long it would take to travel between any two cities via a straight tunnel.

"Energy changes in a dielectricDear all,

&amp;#x200B;

Quick question about dielectrics. Say you have charged up your capacitor, with a dielectric inside it, and then disconnected it from the power supply. So by Q = VC, as the capacitance decreases but the charge stays the same, the voltage increases. So C decreases, V increases. Then, looking at equations for energy, E = 1/2QV so if voltage increases then the energy increases, and likewise if E = 1/2Q\^2/C, if C decreases then energy increases. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asked to explain why the energy increases once the dielectric is removed. I would have gone straight to use of equations, however, the mark scheme writes:

&amp;#x200B;

Energy increases because: In the polar dielectric molecules align in the field with positive charged end toward the negative plate

Work is done on the capacitor separating the positively charged surface of the dielectric from the negatively charged plate (or vice versa).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss as to what they mean here. Any ideas?

I understand that inserting a dielectric when the power supply is off will increase the capacitance but charge stays the same, so by E = 1/2Q\^2/C, the energy decreases, so the opposite should happen if you remove the dielectric. However, i can't understand why they are talking about the polar molecules of the dielectric. When the dielectric is in the material, the positive poles are attracted to the negative plate, which attracts more electrons to that negative plate. Where does energy come in in the explanation given in the mark scheme?",1

"Anyone have an idea of what is wrong with my experiment in thermal storage?If this belongs on /r/Physics or some other reddit let me know and I'll move it.

# TLDR

Trying to use water to store some heat during afternoon and release it at night (or more functionally store cold at night and release it during afternoon).

# BACKGROUND/REASON

I feel like I am overlooking something major. The thermostat is custom code on an omega 2+ which logs multiple temps including outside from the open weather map api. Code is not a simple is temp above/below value =&gt; turn on/off-it looks at stuff like has the ac been running long enough that cooling limit has been reached for this cycle.

Being south Texas and an older house and upstairs, the hot afternoon has been a struggle even with upstairs having a separate ac unit. To help combat this, precooling happens from like 5am to 10am, but this means it gets up to 3.25 degrees colder during that part just to not be 80+ inside mid afternoon.

I had read an article one time about a company that was making ac systems affordable enough for use in houses that freeze a block of ice at night and use it to cool the house during the heat/peak hours (can't find that article again). One day I thought why not make a hybrid form where it is thermal mass in the air return to (more or less) ""release heat at night and absorb it during the day"" which would help the ac unit.

&amp;#x200B;

# SETUP

Been trying to figure out a way to use thermal mass to help in some way, but didn't want to lug a bunch of cinder blocks upstairs. Realized water and copper pipe is my answer. This is still early phase testing/prototyping, which is why it is just 20 feet coiled 1/2 inch copper and no fins, 12 gallon cooler, holes in lid not sealed, and why the coil is not centered (first iteration it was mounted to cooler lid, but that made things difficult to work with). Pump is a 300 gph pump. Started with 5 gallons of distilled water.

[ EARLY RESULTS

This is the last week of data. Installing it didn't change behavior, but turning the pump on did stabilize the temp, kinda since it seemed to just not let it get as cool while the upper limit didn't really change. Then tried some experiments where added frozen gallons jugs of water which quickly cooled the water down but didn't seem to affect the air. At some point in there I reduced the water to just under 3 gallons (just before the pump started pulling in bubbles), but again no change.

[ is the past day for a better look (with low/high cutoff hidden since the temp is high enough to not interact with them right now). The pump was off the whole time except for the short bit where the water temp went up. This time I had the flow rate of the pump as low as it would go, which was still a large flow of water and a long/high enough length of tube/pipe/resistance that I had to start the flow with it at a higher rate then turn it down.

[ hour data range for a closer look at when the pump was turned on. Data points are 1 minute intervals in all the graphs.

[ \~2/3 of this overlap with the previous image, but better screenshot and the following \~40 minutes

[ EXPECTATIONS/HELP

My expectations going in to this was that in this configuration it would have a small impact, but be a proof of concept so v2 can do more. Figured when the air is cooling down it would be a little slower to cool, but when it was warming up it would resist warming up some too as the copper/water absorb/release heat. Water flow rate could be used to adjust the impact it had a little bit (or thermostat controls times when pump is on/off).

I'm running out of ideas as to what the problem could be. The only other thing I can think of is if it doesn't have enough water. But a possible error that I am going to test tonight and add the results of is if the pump itself is heating the water up, to test will disconnect the tube from pump and turn it on to see if it makes the same heating curve in water temperature.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically what I did was:

&amp;#x200B;

At/Ao = 2\^(-t/h)

where At is amount of time, 3155

Ao is initial amountt, 8310

t is time elapsed, 3.5

and h is half life.

3155/8310 = 2\^(-3.5/h)

0.37966 = 2\^(-3.5/h)

log(0.37966) = -3.5/h\*log2

\-0.9684711129 = -3.5/h \* 0.3010

h = 3.5 \* 0.3010/ -0.9684711129

"Would this be the best place to ask about the potential validity of an experiment proposal?Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Story is: I studied Nuclear Engineering about six years ago, but left in my senior year due to health and financial issues (was studying in the US but had come from the EU).

&amp;#x200B;

During my senior year I had an idea for an experiment that had to do with the potential of saving a considerable amount of energy in the ignition of a fusion reaction (Tokomak confined) and presented it to two of my professors who assured me that the math is correct and told me that indeed the idea had promise and that I should pursue it for my masters-PhD. As mentioned, getting that far is not an option for me (mainly due to finances) and I was wondering if there would be a way to pursue the experiment otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

Having sent to a couple of research centers where I live, I had my idea turned down without said centers reading the written experiment proposal, as I lack the level of degree to make a proper application - which is understandable. I really don't know how I should move forward with this, or if there is anything I can do about it, but I do indeed feel it is a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways thanks for reading through, and please do let me know if I should post this question elsewhere or any other recommendations you may have. Also, do you think it would be safe to post the actual experiment proposal here?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I have an experiment proposal for a fusion reaction that I don't have the proper level of degree to pursue, and would like some advice on how I should present it or if there is anything I can do to pursue it.

"How big are the gravitational effects of a single human body on the motion of planets (on a long time horizon)?(This is going to be a strange question.)

&amp;#x200B;

How big a difference does the existence (or positioning) of a single human body make on the motion of planets in our solar system, millions of years in the future? I know we can't predict what the difference will be, but do we have reason to think that there likely \*will\* be a non-negligible difference?

&amp;#x200B;

Why might there be a non-negligible difference? Well, figuring out the motion of the planets in our solar system is an n-body problem. So that motion is supposed to be chaotic - highly sensitive to changes in initial conditions. At least, on a timescale of [5 million years]( the positions of planets should be highly sensitive to conditions now. But just how sensitive is an n-body system to \*tiny\* perturbations in the gravitational field? 

&amp;#x200B;

A single human body exerts some small amount gravitational force on nearby planets. So, if I add a single human to Earth's population now, or I move them from one position to another, how much would that change the motion of planets in the future? And over what timescale?

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus questions:

*  Would the differences continue to grow over time, or would they eventually diminish to nothing? (I figure that in a sufficiently chaotic system they'd just keep growing, but would be interested to hear otherwise.)
*  Would the effects be similar on the scale of a galaxy, or beyond?",1

"Expansion of the Universe and the Hubble Constant.I was introduced to some cosmology concepts today and it left me with some questions. 
1. The first is to do with the expansion of space. How is that the rate at which the universe expands is relative to the observer? For example, if I am 2 lightyears from a galaxy, space is expanding between me and the galaxy. That much is clear. But if someone is only one light year away from that same galaxy why would that galaxy not be moving away at the same rate? Typing this I just realized that it may because if your closer, then there is less space expanding between the two points, is this why?
2. My second question comes from the hubble constant. We were taught that the age of the universe can be derived by the reciprocal of the hubble constant. But this made no sense to me because as time passes, the age of the universe increases, so how would the hubble constant accurately predict the universes age?

"Lever momentum question photo illustrates question. 


Example A and B are the same lever.

A lever with side L (3m long) has 10 N while side x(1m long) has 25 N of force. To balance the lever side L need only 8.33 N. So there is a surplus on side L of 1.67 N

question: on point B when lever on side x is at a 45 degree angle then comes down on side L with 1.67 N of force until it becomes level to the ground( lever becomes parallel to the ground)
If the 10N on side L as it's coming down becomes level to the ground, at the point where the lever is parallel to ground and the 10N is suddenly removed as the downward momentum is in play, 

will the downward momentum have enough kinetic energy to keep lifting side x with the 25N once 10N is removed on side L?

Or regardless of the downward momentum,  once the 10N is removed will side x instantly begin to move down? 

I hope this is clear but it is kind of complicated for me to explain. I'm thinking once the moment of side L comes down from a distance,  once the 10N are instantly removed when it becomes parallel to the ground it will still have enough momentum to keep lifting the 25N for a foot or so before side x with 25N comes crashing down.

"Data/signal processing: which method to use to find the frequency?For a reaserch project, we had to study swimming particles.  Depending on the initial conditions and varying parameters, we observed a huge difference in the behaviour of those swimmers. Now, the goal is to quantify our observations.

&amp;#x200B;

The particles (w=0.5 mm, l=1 mm) are spinning with an angular velocity that we increment by changing our settings and depending on the spin of each particle, the group swims at a different speed. 

We recorded everything on the lab camera and processed each video resulting in a huge amount of data such as coordinates and angle with the X axis of each particle. 

&amp;#x200B;

When trying to analyse the angular velocity, we encountered a few problems. 

One of them (comes from the image processing) was that the range of the angle is \[0,180\]. At a very low frequency, the particles align with the X axis, in such a way that a small perturbation results in an angle rapidly switching between a huge value (\~180°) and a very small value (\~0°). We were able to overcome this problem by considering the sinus of the angle. 

The result is a sinusiodal signal whose frequency should give us the angular velocity right? 

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is the following:

**How can I get that frequency from a list of numbers?** 

I tried to use the FFT function (working with NumPy) but it doesn't seem to work well, perhaps because of the noise. It seems like there are too much methods to smooth the signal and I don't really have the time to go through precise documentation to pick the right one.

"Voltage drop, AC, and DCOne of the reasons we use AC to transmit power is because it looses less power over longer distances. But the way I understand it, AC should actually loose more power than DC.  Here is why. 

Intuitively I can imagine electrons in a wire like a long string of balls connected by springs, to simulate there repulsive forces, i believe in thermodynamics something similar is done. 

Power is lost because when you push on one end x distance, since the force has to travel across so many springs friction causes some of that force to be absorbed in the compression so that the ball at the end will move &lt;x.  So if you vibrate the first ball in the chain, if the wire is long enough the ball at the end may not even move at all,  in this way I imagine AC current will diminish in a very long wire. 

&amp;#x200B;

But for DC current, when you compress the first ball and continue to push, once the chain reaches its max compression the current would then flow without relativity any more loss, in other words you only have the initial loss of power to get every movement, the opposite would be pulling a loose chain until it is taut, all the pulling until it is taut is doing no work but then the chain is good, as opposed to pulling the chain then pushing it back before it reaches taut, which would be the AC analog. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what is wrong with my model? It seems intuitively DC would be a better choice for more efficient travel across long distance.",1

Ie, if we start at a particular thermodynamic state (N, T, S, P, V, U) with non-zero Helmholtz free-energy, and start isothermally isochorically extracting work until the Helmholtz free-energy is zero, does that define a *unique path* between those two points in phase space? Are there non-unique possible termini at which the Helmholtz free energy is zero?

Any thoughts appreciated.

"Physics Question I spent 3 whole days on still cant answer.If anyone could help me out with this it will be massively appreciated! (Doesn't even need to be an answer just a little help to get me in the right direction I guess) I searched all over the net and cant figure out how to answer this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am given the position, velocity and mass, of two colliding balls in a simulation.

Simulation here: [ (under the advanced tab)

&amp;#x200B;

My job is to add a THIRD BALL and give it a VELOCITY, and a POSITION (Must use a mass of 1kg) so that the momentum of all three colliding balls add up to zero, In addition to this, they must collide simultaneously in an effort to get them all to stick. (Also the collision is 0% elastic).

&amp;#x200B;

I believe I have been able to figure out the Velocity of the 3rd ball, using the conservation of momentum. (split into the X and Y direction) like this:

M before=M after

M1+M2+M3=0

M1+M2=(-M3)

&amp;#x200B;

So my answers for the 3rd balls velocity:

0.6m/s in the Y direction

0.25 In the X direction

&amp;#x200B;

Its just the position I am having a really hard time with. Thanks to anyone in advance!

"This table is made of particles...which are excitations in fieldsHello learned physicists.  I have a relatively simple question about matter to which I hope a simple answer is possible. 

I understand a small bit about particle physics and field theory in that I read pop science books and articles and find it all fascinating to think about (without ever really grasping the mathematics behind it all).  Nowadays it seems to me that matter is best described as quantum excitations in fields, so Higgs, electromagnetic etc. 

I am sitting at a table here, and the table is made of wood, which is made of different molecules, which themselves are made of different atoms comprising of electrons, protons (made of quarks) and neutrons (also formed of quarks) which are all quantum excitations in their fields.  You could say they are particles outstanding in their fields? Little joke there

So these particles, I presume, don’t actually sustain over the lifetime of the table, or even from moment to moment? If I could somehow identify the particles (which I think is impossible due to the uncertainty principle) would we see that the particles are constantly changing, flashing in and out of existence, but their fields remain, which is what gives the perception of concreteness?  And as the years pass, and the elements break down the table, attrition of particles in the air, rain, whatever else, constantly coming up against those of the table see the table being broken down and dissolved.  Is that correct?

What I’m asking, I suppose, is that from moment to moment, are the particles which make up something solid, actually in flux constantly and at an imperceptible fast speed, or are the particles sort of there, frozen, and remain there until its broken down and changed into something else

Or maybe I’m totally off

Is it saying that that’s the very nature of things or is it saying that that’s as far as we can go to determining the position of the electron. In other words, is it a matter that we, as humans, din’t have the technology to determinate an exact position of an electron, or is it that it’s the very nature of an electron to not have a determined trajectory. Do we not know what determines the electron trajectory or is the trajectory really random?

"Does the rise of electric charge the U(1) symmtry group and the ""complexity"" of the field entail special properties of the EM interaction and charge?Okay, so when we impose phase invariance ( U(1) ) on a field we get through Noether's theorem the conservation of electric charge and consequently EM. But we only get a charge if the field we're dealing with is complex(?), if we try to apply it to (for example) a real scalar field we get no charge. Now I interpreted this (and my prof) as the real field doesn't interact through EM, which is fine, but the question I always had was, what is the relation between the ""complexity"" of the field and charge? 

To answer this question, I went through the following reasoning; Now let's forget about ""complexity"" as it's in essence just a neat mathematical trick to deal with 2-element vectors ( Or is it ?? ) so we represent out complex field as a (real) vector field with 2-elements.

And now I cut the question intro smaller questions: 

+ If this is just a mathematical edifice, can we reformulate the mathematical framework so that the 2-element vector field becomes a real scalar field and keep the electric charge property ( U(1) will change as well)? 

+ Do we lose the charge information by doing this? 

+ If not then what else do we lose?

+ If yes, then what is so special about electric charge that we need the extra ""degree of freedom""? 

+ And consequently what does this tell us about the EM interaction and it's need for that ""degree of freedom""?

And what does this reasoning say about the other interactions and their unitary groups? (I'm not advanced enough)",1

Idk if it’s worse when the grass is still green because of the oils, or when it dries up because it’s so dry. In Michigan, lower peninsula it is about 60 degrees and overcast, a “rainy day” type of day even though it’s not supposed to rain. So at least the sun is not beating down on it or anything. Tomorrow it is supposed to storm basically all day starting at 9 am. But the weather could be wrong (esp for Michigan), should I worry about it if it gets sunny? If it did catch on fire, it wouldn’t really spread because the piles are just in the yard and not next to anything in a ten foot radius.

"Intuitive way of thinking about graphene's linear dispersion relation? (Not a HW question)Hi everyone,

I'm a first year physics PHD student, and in my QM class I had a problem where I had to show that graphene has a linear dispersion relation close to the Dirac Points, where the positive energy bands and negative energy bands touch. This linear dispersion is analogous to the linear dispersion that massless particles have. So, I was wondering is there a deep connection here? Or is this just a coincidence?",1
"Can you explain shear stress to meHow can a tangential force do anything to an object if it isn't in contact with the surface/plane? 

I get it if two objects are in contact, obj 1 on top of obj 2, obj 1 experiences a force rightward, and the friction causes a tangential force to obj 2, which causes it to deform because obj2 is held to the ground. 

What exactly is shear stress? I already watched a couple of videos but they dont address how the force causes deformation if it ain't touching the object. In my understanding, a force only does something if it has a component that is acting on the object. A tangential force is 0 degrees and shouldn't do anything???",1
"Exam Question on Gas Laws relating to Volume/PressureIn a recent exam a question I was asked “Using the kinetic model of a gas, describe what would happen to the pressure of the gas if its volume were increased”

Now I was a bit confused about the wording of the question as it sounded like it suggested that the volume increased because of the increase in pressure but then again I answered differently.

My answer:

• As volume is increased the particles have a greater distance between them
• So collide with each other and the walls of the container less often
• Less frequent collisions mean less average force is exerted on the container walls, since P=F/a pressure decreases

Is this correct?",1

I have never studied astronomy, all I know is pieced together from articles. Maybe you can help me with these questions about black holes.

#####My understanding
1. According to an outside observer, objects falling into a black hole asymptotically approach the event horizon. 

2. Black holes lose mass due to Hawking radiation and eventually evaporate.

#####Questions
1. Although objects become red shifted and invisible, they never cross the event horizon. Is the horizon covered in a lumpy shell of infalling material, frozen in place?

2. Would this shell have a solid surface?

3. As the mass of the black hole increases, would the growing radius of the event horizon cause these objects to pass the horizon?

4. When the black hole eventually evaporate, would the objects (except maybe the ones that fell through due to 3) be free to reach the observer?",1

"Twin paradoxTwin paradox: two twins, 1 stays at Earth and the other travels away in a spaceship and comes back. I know how the twin paradox is resolved because one twin accelerates when he comes back, breaking the symmetry of the problem. Still something's not really clear to me.

"A question on simulating quantum computing and its relation to real world simulations.I am having difficulty describing what I want to say when it comes to quantum computing, so please bare with me if I make mistakes in my phrasing.

From everything that I have read on quantum computing and how it works, it seems that the inherent advantage of using quantum computing is that we get ""free"" computation in the form of probabilities when we read various states of the qbits and their relations to other qbits.  That is to say it is easier to do quantum computation then it is to do simulated quantum computation.  So while there are websites out there where you can do simulated quantum computation all the way up to 22 Qbits, its seems that it would be impossible to do simulated quantum computation on lets say 256 Qbits.   Where as it seems we would be able to do quantum computation with 256 Qbits if we get the machinery in place, etc....   With that in mind, it seems impossible to perform a 100% accurate simulation of any part of a universe where you have to deal with even only 256 Qbits.  Am I wrong in my assumption?  Like, how can we even come close to performing an accurate simulation of even the simplest molecular interactions if we are unable to simulate all of the underlying processes, such as quantum interactions, etc....",1

"Could inertia also be connected to extra dimensions?So I have absolutely no training in physics but I do love the subject.  I love critically thinking about physics and the nature of reality. 
(Unfortunately table top physics isnt a thing anymore)

But I had a intriguing question and never had a professional to ask.

I wonder if inertia could be connected to extra dimensions and the motion of energy and mass (because E=mc2) through those extra dimensions. 
I was thinking about this because I know that space and time are sometimes considered to be a interwoven fabric of reality, but that you can effect one or the other by changing your acceleration. 

I am wondering if inertia could be thought of the same way as time and space.  
Can the resistence of mass be due to it already having a nonzero motion through unseen spaces? And when we apply a motion through space and time it subtracts from the nonzero motion through another dimensional space? Giving us the resistance we observe?",1

"What are the effects of assumptions and interpretation on understanding quantum mechanics?I often wonder how much of the strangeness of quantum mechanics results from the underlying assumptions in developing quantum mechanics as well as how the results of quantum mechanics are interpreted.  

For example, how does quantum mechanics treat particles and space, and what sort of assumptions do we have to make in order to formalize our treatment of particles and space?  Does interpretation of something like the uncertainly principal require impose additional assumptions?

Most articles and books written for the lay person proceed as if particles are 0-dimensional points, space is built up as a continuous division of points, and the uncertainty principal imposes limits on what we can know through measurement.  In doing so, we are assuming space is a continuous object, there are particles in space that occupy a single point, and once measured, a particle has a well defined location even if we cannot entirely know that location.  

However, I think that if one changes the background assumptions, the understanding of what happens above changes.  (I don't think these are great examples nor do I believe them - they're just easy to think about and thus a useful starting point.)  If we still assume space is continuous but particles had some size and shape which is able to move in a non-uniform manner (different parts moving in different speeds or directions), our inability to measure its position could be related to how we try and collapse this into a single positional value.  Or, what if particles are just bigger than what we would expect and in doing a measurement, we are only seeing a given piece a particle?",1

"White light in: single slit, young's double slit and diffraction gratingI'm just wondering how best to understand how white light behaves in single slit, double slit and a diffraction grating experiments.

&amp;#x200B;

This is apparently the image for Young's double slit: [ know that by w = lambda\*D/s, as red light has a larger wavelength the fringe spacing will be greater, meaning the fringes themselves are wider. If you look at the central fringe, where all wavelengths have interfered constructively, why is it tinged with a kind of murky red? Is this because the red fringe is larger? If so, then, it is clear that the next colour (moving outwards from the centre) is blue, then white, then red. I'm confused how this works with regard to the wavelengths...

&amp;#x200B;

For a diffraction grating, again I understand that directly opposite the beam (source of light), there is constructive interference so you get a thin white line.

If so, how do you get the dominant colours forming the spectrum in between the dark gaps?",1
"Rotating an object by applying forceHello,

I have a question about how to use ""thrusters"" to rotate a landing module. For simplicity, it is all in 2D, the red arrows are the direction of the thrusters when they fire and it is upright, yellow is the rotation axis.

I have an inital rotation of the ship thetha, and I want to figure out how much thrust I have to apply on what thruster to rotate it back so the rotation of it is correct again (aka. no rotation). All thrusters always fire orthogonal to the surface they are mounted to.

What I know is (i) the mass of the object, (ii) distance from the thrusters to the axis, and (iii) how much force each thruster can apply in Newtons.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder how I can go from those pieces of information to a change in angular velocity? Or in other words, how I know how many degrees/radians I have turned if I have fired a thruster for *n* seconds with a force of *f* Newtons.

&amp;#x200B;

To solve this problem, I have looked at the formula for torque which seems to be ""T=F\*r\*sin(theta)"". F is the force, r the distance from the axis, and theta is the angle at which the force is applied. In my example, if I would move up the thrusters slightly, this should always be pi/2 because the thrust vector is orthogonal to the surface, so I can simplify to ""T=F\*r"". If I say that I apply 300N and the thruster is 2m away, I apply 600\[Nm\] of force but know I am stuck, and I have no idea how to calculate the change in angle if I apply this force for n seconds.

"Expanding on the rubber sheet analogyHello. Not long ago I took part in a discussion about general relativity and the well-known rubber sheet analogy, and it made me realize there was a gap in my understanding of it. I went looking for answers and I believe I managed to fill the gap, but I'd like to hear a confirmation that my current understanding is on the right track.

The rubber sheet is a great tool to understand how gravity can affect photons even though they don't have any mass - while they are always moving in a straight line, this straight line can appear curved without taking the effect of gravity into account. It *seems* to explain attraction of two bodies (a marble will fall into the ""well"" created by the more massive object on the rubber sheet), but that explanation itself requires gravity to work, so that's not really helpful.

This is the gap I was talking about. I understood that mass warps space around it, causing straight lines in its vicinity to appear curved. In addition it causes objects with mass to attract one another. I realized I view these two effects as separate and my original understanding couldn't explain how both of those effects could be explained by a single cause.

Looking for answers, I realized that the rubber sheet analogy fails mainly because it only shows us the effect of gravity on space rather than spacetime. So what I did was to imagine a model that takes time into account. Normally the two dimensional sheet represents our three spacial dimensions, but to be able to fit in time as well, we'll have to further reduce our three dimensional space to just a line, with the other dimension of the sheet representing time.

An object staying in place would keep its spacial coordinate the same while the temporal coordinate would steadily increase as the time passes, effectively moving in a straight line. However, if there's another massive object, the sheet gets warped same as in the original analogy and the straight line representing the object ""staying in the same place"" gets curved towards the massive object, which in effect translates into the attraction.

So what gravity does is that it curves the ""future"" of nearby objects towards its centre, meaning they will be closer in the future, which means that they accelerate towards it.

Is this somewhat correct? Can this model more faithfully represent how gravity works? Are there any obvious problems or shortcomings?",1

Electrons are swept up and interact with a magnetic field. This changes their velocity but is this only in direction? Is the speed changed? This seems to be the field giving a nudge to the particle so why is light emitted? Is it simply because it's speed hadn't increased? Can this type of light be emitted at other frequencies as well?
     Does this field come from the plasma in the accretion disk? Were these electrons deeper than the disk itself? Why does the disk emit X Ray light but the electrons only produce low energy radio waves? 
     My final question is if gravity pulls only towards the center of mass then how do objects initially headed towards the black hole somehow get ejected. I know photons can escape if they are emitted outward (before the event horizon) but they get redshifted. How do particles escape at high speeds when they got most of that energy falling into they field? Also if the accretion disk was the equator why do the radiation jets get released at the poles? Is that gravity or another field?",1
"Intro to physics - Can you check my answer to a word problem(final velocity)?A helicopter is at a height of 55.0 meters above the earth and a package is thrown vertically down with a speed of 2.00 m/s. Ignoring air resistance: What is the final velocity at the moment it hits ground?

What I did: vf^2 = vi^2 + 2ax

= (2.00m/s)^2 -2(9.81m/s^2 )(-55.0 m)

vf = sqrt(1083.1 m^2 /s^2 )

vf = 32.9 m/s

Therefore its final velocity is 32.9 m/s

"This is out of curiosityOk so a few days ago I was climbing a big rope(You know the 30-40 cm diameter ones that you put on the roof and climb them during pe? Yeah that one) without anything to keep me safe(I knew it was a stupid idea but I just went with it anyway) and I managed to tear my skin on two places while falling back down - one a bit worse than the other and I also felt quite a beat of heat afterwards. So I got curious. How much force was exerted onto my hands and why didn't my entire hand get its skin ripped apart and instead only on two places I got hurt. I asked my physics teacher to help me out but sadly she is always really busy with projects and other stuff so she just took a quick glance at this and told me that it's going to be a very tedious thing to calculate. After a bit of counting, I could count about 40 points on my hands where they touch the rope and when I told her about it she said the easiest way to calculate this would be to assume that all of them are the same size and are under the same amount of force. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, no exact calculations can be made unless there is a 3d scan of how I hold the rope so for simplicity's sake let's assume that I held the rope with both of my hands at about 40 points of contact. Let's also say that each point of contact is a circle with a diameter of 1 cm. Considering clothes and boots let's say I weigh about 90 kilograms. The skin on my hands is a bit thicker than a normal person's because in my spare time I go climbing. I am about 190 cms tall and I made  6 steps up from about my waistline to standing upright so let's assume I fell about 4 meters. The fall itself wasn't all that fast I would say about 1m/s but my hands felt quite hot after it. If I were to guess they were probably about 30-40 degrees Celsius and took like 2-3 minutes to cool off. The rope itself wasn't all that rough. Can't say I have used a lot of ropes in my life but let's assume it's a standard roughness one. And I think that's everything needed to set things in motion.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until now, I have been playing around with simple forces. Like two cubes attached together with a string that can be neither compressed nor moved(So basically a pillar with no weight) being pulled or pushed at different angles and having to solve the force that is applied to them, so I have no idea what to do with the 40 points of contact that are on an imperfect object like a hand. I don't even know if they matter or not like for me it sounds logical that you can't just lump them in as one thing that has a force applied on it but for all I know my intuition might be wrong. So any ways I can pull this off with the minimal amount of effort and the highest possible amount of accuracy?

&amp;#x200B;

As an 11th grader that thinks he is finally leaning the stuff needed to start solving problems from real life, it sounds like I'm an awful student. What even is the point of studying physics if I cannot even solve simple problems like these?

"[Question] Gravitational waves on a macroscopic scaleSo this is just a thought experiment to help me understand what gravitational waves are, I don’t want to start a vacuum decay or strange matter type fear anywhere...

But basically to understand weird concepts I like to bring those to understandable concepts, scale them up or down and see what happens...

And today my thought is about gravitational wave... If I understand correctly these compress space without really affecting it? Meaning if a pole would get compressed, it would not get any stress from it correct?

But what if a truly massive wave hit us, what would we see or feel? Does not matter how large, just need to visualize it somehow... Even if we are talking about a wave that would need more energy than there is in the known universe... 

If I understand correctly, we would not notice anything? Appart from some weird visual stuff since light would be able to travel much faster through this compressed space?

vf = sqrt(1083.1 m2 /s2 )

Since the observer is at the centre of the train and the speed of light is a fixed value, the observer must perceive the photons as simultaneous.

"Does vacuum energy and the expansion of space violate the conservation of energy?Space is expanding but the density of vacuum energy of space is essentially constant. This means that the amount of energy in the universe is increasing, violating the conservation of energy.

According to [this]( Scientific American article:
&gt; It turns out that in Einstein’s theory of general relativity, regions of space with positive energy actually push space outward. As space expands, it releases stored up gravitational potential energy, which converts into the intrinsic energy that fills the newly created volume. So even the expansion of the universe is controlled by the law of energy conservation.

Is that something most physicists agree upon? Wouldn't this mean the universe will stop expanding at some point, or is there an infinite amount of ""gravitational potential energy"" preexisting in the universe? If the latter is the case, that seems to also break the conservation of energy.

"[General Relativity] Black holes, outside observers, holographic principle and entropyNot my specialty, but I always wondered if these ideas are connected or if it's just my mind stretching it.

It is my current understanding that for an observer far from a non-rotating black hole, they never really see matter fall into the event horizon. It just asymptotically approaches the event horizon as its light gets redshifted.

If that's accurate, then I imagine the result for an outside observer is that all matter that's falling into the blackhole should  be seen as an ever-falling red-shifting very thin spherical shell.

Q1: How would any observer ever see a black hole increase in size if nothing ever crosses the event horizon?

Q2: Wouldn't this asymptotic behavior lead to black holes being perceived as an ever red-shifting spherical shell?

The holographic principle and the black hole entropy are related to the surface area of a black hole's event horizon. Since all information that fell into the blackhole is seen as asymptotically approaching its boundary, then all the information whose future is in the interior volume of the event horizon should be compressed in a thin spherical shell on the event horizon.

Q3: Can this be seen as a valid intuition for why the black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon, and its relation to the holographic principle?

Basically, is it all just a property of how outside observers perceive the asymptotic trajectories of infalling particles?",1

"Steam Pressure in a cylinder with a movable piston at end of strokeHi, there.

&amp;#x200B;

So, while what I am looking for is a way to calculate the Mean Effective Pressure acting on a piston in a steam engine.  To get there, I believe that I can use the average pressure minus the back pressure on the other side of the cylinder.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm coming up short on figuring the average pressure.  Say I have a given volume, V1 with the piston at the top of the cylinder, with saturated steam at pressure P1, which has a given temperature T1 (that can be looked up from charts).  Now, I don't really care about temperature, but it's sitting there in the combined gas law equation, so I figure it should be accounted for.

&amp;#x200B;

Once that steam expands, the piston will have moved to the far end of its stroke such that we now have volume V2.

For figuring the average pressure, how do I calculate P2, given that T2 is going to be locked to P2, but is currently unknown?",1

"Work done, resistive forces and energy changesQuestion regarding these:

I have been taught the eqn:

delta(KE) + delta(GPE) + delta(EPE) = -friction + work done.

I have used this equation in many cases to find the work done for example in Hooke's law questions, or when an object is moving up or down a plane.

However, in a question, if I know that there is a frictional force, but do not know its magnitude and am asked to find the work done given the change in kinetic and GPE, I am supposed to use:

initial energy - final energy = work done.

Where has the friction disappeared to in this equation?

Also, initial energy - final energy = -1 \* ( delta(KE) + delta(GPE) + delta(EPE)), which, according to the above equation, is: friction - work done. 

Am i missing something key here about energy changes? Is the work done equal to the friction?",1
"[Subtle Question that Starts Obvious]: Changes in electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, right?I'm about 99.999...% sure that the answer to the above question is ""yes.""

So now... The subtler question.

When typical high school/intro undergrad books will say that light slows down in a medium that is not a vacuum. But after reading a bit of Feynman, I'm not sure that is entirely correct:  I'm understanding this chapter correctly, let us set up a situation where we have a light source on the left, a magical field detector on the right; vacuum everywhere, except a sheet of glass in between the two. Then, the source is switched on.

If the glass sheet is not present, then the detector will read oscillating E and B fields corresponding to the frequency of the light being emitted. The time it will take for the detector to sense these changes is how long it takes light to propagate through the vacuum space. So far, so good, I think.

Now, the sheet of glass is positioned between the source and detector, and then the source is turned on. Will there be a difference in the time it takes for the detector to start showing the oscillating E and B fields?

If I understand Feynman's text correctly, the answer is ""no""; in the medium of the glass, the phase velocity of light in the glass has slowed, because the oscillating E field induces an opposing E field in the glass by forcing the charge in the glass to line up/polarize. But the group velocity of light has not changed; throughout all of space, changes in the field continue to propagate at c. So, say, if with no sheet, it took 1 second for the detector to get a reading with no glass present then it should also take the same time--1 second-- for the detector to get a reading  when the glass is present. But, because the distinction between group and phse velocity is a fairly advanced concept, high school students are not exposed to this concept, nor are undergrads until they get to sophomore/junior/senior year, and instead the concept of ""phase velocity slows down"" is shorthanded to ""light slows down in a medium.""

Is this the correct understanding of Feynman's text, as well as a correct interpretation of current understanding about light? Or am I getting something wrong?

If you look over at the[ Dielectric section of the physics hypertextbook]( it says

So Capacitance (the ratio of charge to voltage) is inversely proportional to the Electric field strength right? 

But if you look over [at this website]( it says:
&gt; Capacitance is directly proportional to the electrostatic force field between the plates. This field is stronger when the plates are closer together. Therefore, as the distance between the plates decreases, capacitance increases.

"What exactly happens when a gas is ionised (such as in a lightning strike)?Ok so you can take a gas and ionise it by putting a high enough potential difference across it that the electrons rip off the atoms and move to the anode, producing a current (like lightning, for example).

"A black hole universe 

Hi all

Probably a silly question, but I was thinking about this last night and can't get it out of my head. Hopefully someone can explain this to me.

Imagine you have a universe that is big and has some (non-trivial) average density of matter. From a point at the edge of this universe, the gravitational effect could be calculated based on an assumption that all of the matter was located at a single point (i.e. the centre of mass of the universe) \[correct me if I am wrong on this\].

So I was thinking that if you made the universe bigger, but kept the average density of matter the same, the amount of matter (proportional to volume) would go up by the cube of the increase in radius, but the amount of gravity at the edge of the universe would increase as you only need to divide by r squared.

Firstly, is the above correct, or am I making a mistake somewhere?

If the above is correct, then it would imply that if you grow the universe (but keep the average density the same, i.e. add uniform shells of matter at the outer edge), then at some point the edge of the universe will have enough gravity to effectively make it an event horizon. So the universe will become a black hole.

The problem I have with this is that shell theorem would say that each shell added should have no gravitational effect on the objects inside it. So to anything inside the universe there is no impact of the universe changing into a black hole. That seems really weird. It also seems to imply that for a given density, there is a maximum allowable size for a universe; is this right?

Again apologies if this is just me missing some really basic stuff, but would appreciate pointers to how to better understand this sort of stuff.",1

"What (textbooks) should I read during the summer?So my exams will be over in two days and I'm hoping to keep doing/reading some physics stuff over the summer so I won't forget almost everything I learned (as I did last year).

I'm planning to take the courses on classical physics (on Lagrangians, but I know a bit already) and electromagnetic field theory (with SR) the semester after the summer, so I hope I could get some recommendations as to what textbooks you guys would recommend on those subjects.

I'm also thinking of taking the particle physics course that semester, but the only prerequisite for that course is the standard QM course with bra-ket notation, simple harmonic oscillators, hydrogen atoms, and non-degenerate time-independent perturbation theory. I also took the course after that, which covers degenerate time-independent perturbation theory, non-degenerate time-dependent perturbation theory, WKB approximation, the variational method, scattering, and energy level transitions, since I've heard that the standard QM course doesn't do enough to prepare for the particle physics course.

I also want to continue doing some nuclear physics stuff after the course I took this semester (and stat mech, but I can access Blundell &amp; Blundell), so if anyone has any pointers, that'd be great too.

"How does Tb keeps on cooling after undershooting Tr in this ""thermal inductor""In this paper from A. Schilling, X. Zhang and O. Bossen they talk about a ""thermal inductor"" consisting of a Peltier element in series with an inductance. Somehow the inductance is supposed to let the temperature Tb drop below Tr by ""imposing an inertia"" on the heat flow.
By my understanding the inductance self induces a current following Lenz law, therefore counteracting its origin. Wouldn't the inductance raise Tb over Tr again, instead of helping it drop below Tr. Obviously I'm wrong but i dont know where. I understand how the Seebeck and peltier effect works in a peltier element still it ends up heating Tb instead of cooling it further down in my conception.

"Question about relativity and causalityMy understanding of special relativity is that, while different observers moving at different speeds may disagree on the timings of events, they all agree on causality.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't understand why. I recently read The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene and he uses an example of a train moving at relativistic speed. Positioned on the train is a device which emits a flash of light. At an equal distance from the device, at opposite ends of the train carriage, are two individuals each armed with a gun. At the instant they see the flash of light they each fire their gun at the opposite individual.

&amp;#x200B;

From on board the moving train, both individuals see the flash of light at the exact same instant (because it has travelled the same distance in opposite directions) so both fire their guns at the exact same time. Which means they're both dead.

&amp;#x200B;

But for an observer positioned on the ground, watching the train shoot past at relativistic speed, the individual facing the direction of travel sees the flash of light first, because he's moving INTO the beam of light. Brian Greene uses this example to illustrate that different observers will disagree on the simultaneity of events. But surely that means he will fire his gun first (because he sees the flash first) which means he kills the individual opposite before they have a chance to fire their gun. Which results in a totally different outcome, not just a difference of perspective.

What is the moment of inertia of H2O for rotation around an axis, through the center of mass and parallel to the z-axis? Repeat for the two axes parallel to x and y and through the center of mass. The three orthogonal axes are called principal axes.

I calculated the moment of inertia for the water molecule, when oxygen is in origo, in another exercise. I also found the center of mass, which is (6.6\*10\^-12    ,   0).

"Simple Physics Question? (Projectile Acceleration/Velocity)**An object is launched at a 45 degree angle from ground level and lands 240m away due to gravity; ignoring wind resistance, what is the initial velocity of the object?** What would be the simplest way of answering this? 

My main thought would be to find a calculation between how long it takes for the object's vertical velocity to go up and back down to the ground vs. the time it takes for the object to reach 240m. If T equals time of flight, VL equals the horizontal velocity at time 0, and VH equals the vertical velocity at time 0, then does:

* T = 240m/VL
* T = 2 \* ( VH/9.8m/s^(2) )

The first equation is pretty self explanatory, while the second comes from the time it takes for the object's vertical velocity to decelerate to 0 m/s due to gravity (presumably VH/9.8 m/s^(2)?) which would, since it is launched from ground level, be the same time it takes for it to accelerate back to the ground.

Because the object is launched at a 45 degree angle, you can say that VH and VL are equal, and so VL = VH = VS therefore the true (45 degree) velocity of the object equals VS \* sqrt(2). So by setting the two equals equal to each other you get 240m/VS = 2 ( VS/9.8m/s^(2) ) which gives VS = 34.29m/s and gives the true velocity as 48.49m/s.

b) Assume a larger mass is pulling  a globe to itself (and vice versa) and assume that this large object cannot be tormented. Why doesn't the globe collapse in order to be closer to the center of gravity? Or why doesn't it simply get denser? And if it does, would it also get colder as it's molecules are now having a harder time to move around?
c) Assume a large mass that is pulling a body of liquid and vice versa. As the liquid hits the surface, if the force is strong enough, would it turn into a solid, as it's molecules would try to be closer to the center of gravity; or does this connect to some other complicated system?

"How does Time Dilation work?I thought I understood Time Dilation in Special Relativity, but then upon thinking about one of the most commonly cited examples (space travel), I realised I don’t really get what it means, in terms of who experiences what. 

Let’s have a simple example. I have an astronaut who is going to board a ship heading to Alpha Centauri, 4.367 light years away. The ship, handwaving engine requirements, travels at 0.8c (~2.4 x 10^8 m/s). Now, ignoring relativistic effects, if you travel 4.367 light years (4.13 x 10^16 metres) at 0.8 c, it should take about 5.46 years. I assume that means 5.46 years would pass *on Earth* as the ship was in transit. Calculating the time dilation effect gives a time of 9.09 years, presumably the time that passes for the astronaut..But that result, as in the maths from SR, seems to contradict what I’ve been told in words about SR. Like, from what I’ve read, time travels slower for faster objects. How then, can the timespan be *longer* on the ship than on Earth, since a lower rate of time flow should lead to less time elapsing than on Earth? And I’ve read stuff about astronauts theoretically going very fast on a round trip that for them was merely days or weeks, but would be thousands of years on Earth, which again implies the timespan elapsed on the ship should be shorter..So where have I messed up?

So Energy initial equals energy final due to conservation of energy

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(velocity final)^2 + mgh

velocity final is actually (1/3 velocity initial) so

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(1/3velocity initial)^2 + mgh

mass cancels out entirely, and now velocity initial can just be referred to as ""v""

"Not a typical physics question but looking for advice as a high-school physics student.Hi all,

I'm a high school senior that is currently taking AP Physics (Algebra-Based) which I assume is like the introductory course for college level physics. We had the AP Exam for it last Tuesday so we're not actually doing anything for the rest of the month in that course apart from one thing and that's what I'm here to ask about.

I want to get into computer engineering, but the college that I want to go to requires that I take *Calculus* based Physics. The credit that I get for algebra based physics from the exam I took last week does nothing for my engineering curriculum. As such, I signed up for the Physics C: Mechanics AP Exam which is this coming Monday, as this is the exam I need to get a 4 in to have any credit towards my engineering curriculum. 

I'm also in AP Calculus BC, which is the Calculus 2 equivalent in college. I'm doing *really* well in that class and have not a single worry about the calculus AP exam that's happening soon, so I have a good grasp on calculus I'd say. Physics C: Mechanics incorporates lots of calculus topics, since its Calculus based after all. 

I've been looking over a lot of released material for Physics C and my general strategy is to try the problem, and look up a worked out solution if I have no idea how to work it out. A lot of the problems I've looked it are very good questions that I've been able to do with my current understanding of physics, but there are a good handful of problems that I cannot answer. I will say that Physics C problems are worded like actual Physics questions instead of how my Algebra based physics sounded more like an English exam, which I can appreciate. 

My question to anyone that can answer it is basically this: What are some fundamental topics or ideas from Physics C that I should learn myself before I go into this exam? I'm pretty good at regular physics, apart from maybe rotational motion which I could use a brush up on. What else can I do apart from look at released Physics C material?

I appreciate anyone that comes forward with any advice. Thank you all!!!!!",1
"I can solve the problems but I don't understand the physicsHi, so I am taking a course this semester called ""Advanced Dynamics"" and at the beginning of the semester the professor did say that the material is very tough but I thought I could hack it. Anyway, the exam is in 6 days so obviously I've been trying to do a lot of work and honestly, I should be okay exam-wise because it's pretty much as the title says. I can solve the question but I don't fully understand why I'm doing why I'm doing (e.g. I feel like I'm just having to learn off by heart that tensors transform the way they do, and properties of covariant and contravariant 4 vectors, without understanding WHY tensors transform the way they do and to an extent how to understand what covariance and contravariance actually is) since I'm only in the first year the prof also said that this is to be expected and that we'll develop a deeper understanding in years 2 and 3 (most people on the course are in a similar situation to me) but it's still frustrating to me. I've never not understood the physics of what I'm doing before, so I'd appreciate any strategies you have used if you've ever been in a similar position to me. Thanks.

TL;DR: I don't understand why I'm doing what I'm doing but I can solve the problems. I understand the algebra but not the physics. How can I understand both?",1
"Conducting plate placed inside parallel plate capacitorThere's a parallel plate conductor with separation of d=3 cm, with voltage of U=150 V. Now we put a large conducting plate with thickness of a=2 cm inbetween so that it does not touch the electrodes and that it is parallel to electrodes. What is the voltage of the capacitor now?

Thus far: I think I've calculated the charge over area on the sides of the plate and I'm not sure if I can even get the potential difference between electrodes and plate sides from that. Alleged solution is the original electric field (E=U/d) times (d-a), which can be wrong. I don't understand how you can assume the field out of the plate does not change. My plan was calculating the potential difference between the sides and the electrodes on each side and getting the Voltage from that, so overall a pretty fundamental problem to which I cannot find a solution in my textbooks as it appears.",1
"MomentHere's the problem: [ the solution: [ don't understand why (2) is true and (3) is true. I understand why (1) is false.

**What I've tried:**

(1) If the CG (center of gravity) of the chair is directly above the pivot P, then the chair will balance on its own, with or without the wall. The wall merely serves as a decorative purpose in this case and no force (including N and f) is applied onto the chair.

(2) Using the same example as (1), I do not see the need for the ground to provide friction as there is no N by the wall on the chair.

(3) The example in (1) is an example of the statement. Therefore I assume the wall and the ground to be rough, and the CG to be out of PQ.

Before I proceeded, I remember being taught that if the CG of an object (with no walls and only the ground) is above the pivot point, the object will topple over, due to the net moment produced by the weight when taking moments at the pivot point. 

However, in the problem, if the friction of the wall acts upwards, then it could balance the weight. Since there is friction by the wall, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the wall. Since there is a horizontal force (due to the normal force by the wall), the only force that could counteract it is the friction by the ground to the left. Since there is friction by the ground, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the ground.",1

"No-cloning and information conservation not related?So my question is related to quantum information theory. The conservation of information is related to the fact that all evolution in quantum mechanics is unitary, therefore the information entropy (and consequently information) is conserved.

You also have the No-Cloning theorem. This can be proven and is due the fact that the operators in QM are linear! So not the same reason that information is conserved.

"renormalisation group flow evolutionIt's my understanding that with the renormalisation flow equation you start at the UV cut off at which the average effective action describes the classical action at large energy scales, and as it flows it goes towards an IR scale. As it does this it is integrating out quantum fluctuations and when k=0 it is equal to the quantum effective action. However, the IR scale is large scale, so how is this described by the quantum effective action. To me it seems like it would make more sense to have classical action at the IR and quantum at the UV. I'm trying to understand how the RG flow allows us to see how the theory evolves at microscopic and macroscopic scales but the process of 'integrating out' fluctuations is confusing me, does this mean including them, or taking them out of the effective action?",1

"Predeterminism and timeSo, hear me out. 

If a light source travels 500 million years to reach us. Does that mean from the perspective of the light source when it is creating events or whatever it is doing, everything is in real time, but to us, it is delayed by 500 million years.
If so, then why is it not talked about that we can essentially see the future for the origin of the light source from the future although it doesn't realise what is about to happen (if it had consciousness) from its origin point perspective.

"Simple Angular Momentum QuestionI've been watching some Walter Lewin on YouTube after taking an intro Physics class that discussed torque in the context of statics and force, but not in the context of angular momentum.

Mathematically, it's a cross product, sure, but I was wondering if there was a physical interpretation as to the vector itself (equivalent to how the interpretation of a velocity vector is that it moves with a certain speed in a certain direction or how a position vector describes a point in a certain direction). I was unable to find such a physical interpretation online, and the best I could come up with myself is something along the lines of ""if you look in the direction of an object's angular momentum, it will be rotating clockwise around that vector.""

Am I confusing myself? Or does the direction come simply as a result of the cross product and I just need to accept it?

"planck's equation: why is light frequency inversely proportional to wavelength?Hi, sorry if this is a really basic/stupid question but i've been interested in quantum physics for a while so i decided to challenge myself and learn something new (i come from a completely different background/field).

I've been trying to wrap my head around the photoelectric effect but i'm kind of stuck with something in Planck's equation. The snippet below is from an article about photoelectric effect I'm currently reading

&gt;According to Planck's equation, the energy of a photon is proportional to the light frequency, *ν*:  
&gt;  
&gt;E = h*ν*  
&gt;  
&gt;The light frequency *v* is inversely proportional to wavelength λ:  
&gt;  
&gt;c = λ*ν*

&gt;where c is the speed of light. That means that increasing the wavelength decreases the light's frequency. Therefore, as the wavelength of a photon increases, its energy decreases.

Can someone explain to me why **The light frequency** ***ν*** **is inversely proportional to wavelength λ** ?

At first I thought the energy of a photon is constant but that's obviously wrong from my understanding. Is it simply ""because it just is""?

I calculated the buoyant force on a human at sealevel by the following means:

\[; F\_B = F\_T - F\_B ;\]

\[; F\_B = P\_T A - P\_B A ;\]

\[; F\_B = A (P\_T - P\_B) ;\]

\[; F\_B = A \\rho g h ;\]

Then estimating (for a human): \[; h = 1.75 m;\], \[; m = 68 kg ;\], \[; \\rho = \\frac{1.2 kg}{m\^3} ;\] (this is the density of air at sea level), \[; A= \\pi (0.1524)\^2 m\^2 ;\]

\[; F\_B = 1.5 N ;\]

So this would mean that a scale would read to weigh 1.5 N less than you actually weigh. But my question is ""If your feet will press against the ground, inhibiting air from going in between the two. Will this decrease the pressure on the bottom giving you an even higher buoyant force?"".

"Hello peeps, I need some help on one of my work, energy, power assignments. Could someone help out a little bit please?Mr brown of mass 85kg, is standing on an inclined slope of 40° to the horizontal. The slope is sprayed with water and the coefficient of static friction drops to 0,5. From rest he starts uniformly accelerating down the slope.
Calculate the resultant force acting on Mr Brown.",1

"Angles between edges homework question- MasteringPhysics (online)Hey all. I'm taking my first physics class this summer and so far its feeling alright, but theres a question on my homework that is stumping me, and theres no tips or hints on correct format of answer, so I am afraid to just try an answer out of fear of losing points so I was hoping for some feedback. Question is (and I know y'all cant see the figure):

A cube is placed so that one corner is at the origin and three edges are along the *x*\-, *y*\-, and *z* \-axes of a coordinate system (the figure (Figure 1)). Use vectors to answer the questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

a is at the origin. b is on the z axis, is the height of the cube. c is on the zy plane, extending right of the z axis to make the length. d is diagonal from a, and is the width of the cube, extending from c. Using the formula for theta, (arctan Y/X), I came up with arctan((ABsinA°+ADsinA°)/(ADcosA°)), essentially our Ys over Xs. Am I somewhat on track with what the answer should be? The format of answering with vectors confuses me. Please help if you can, thank you!!!!",1

"Most Efficient Way of Becoming Fluent in the Mathematical MethodsI'm a third year undergrad astrophysics student. I want to continue into theoretical physics (more specifically cosmology), but I am still very clunky with the math. I have a well-developed intuition and I want to devote this year to becoming fluent in the mathematical formalism. Could you suggest a fast and efficient approach to filling up the gaps (from the bottom: calculus and linear algebra to tensor analysis and differential equations) and developing problem solving skills? Any books, routines, schedules you've found useful etc. will also be very helpful.

(Note that I'm not talking about a couple of months. This is something I'll be working on for a year.)",1
"Can someone explain Kirchhoff's Rules?Exam tomorrow, and this is one of the last things giving me trouble so any help would be appreciated. I'm a chemist by major, so I understand how batteries and all that generally work on a chemical level, and I'm having serious problems with understanding this. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ here we have 2 batteries in a circuit connected so that the electrons are flowing on two parallel lines which join then loop around to the anode.  But in the drawing, the current is flowing from the anode(I think) of the 17.5 V battery to the anode of the 4 V battery, then out the Cathode of the 4V battery to the cathode of the 17.5 V battery. Sorry if that's unclear

&amp;#x200B;

Now I understand the difference between a galvanic and an electrolytic cell, and that in theory pushing electrons and energy the ""wrong way"" through the battery will result in the non spontaneous reaction occurring. But that isn't what is happening here. Somehow the current is entering the anode, where it would then proceed to reduce the anode, but instead not only is it not being reduced, it is somehow oxidizing the Cathode through what I suppose would be the salt bridge, and this doesn't appear to have any negative effects. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently it ""doesn't matter what way you draw the current"" but then why not draw it correctly? And besides, every time I do draw what reasonably makes sense to me I get it wrong, and when I bring it to the teacher the first thing they do is draw the damn circuit like the picture above. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone explain how this picture is physically possible? Or where I'm mistaken in my reasoning? Or hopefully some way to do these that makes sense? 

&amp;#x200B;

Preferably without the starting phrase ""forget everything you know about how circuits work and draw the current going in random directions. I sort of get the junction and loop rules, but I can't actually apply them because the positive/negatives don't follow any rhyme or reason.

"If a snowball is rolling down a hill, collecting snow as it goes and thus getting bigger, will it speed up or slow down?Assuming all conditions are ideal and that the snowball pics up snow at a consistent rate with no imperfections, making a perfectly round surface, does a snowball rolling down a hill that's getting bigger speed up, slow down, or say the same speed? Hows does this vary if the hill is at certain slopes or if its parabolically shaped? What if the hill is shaped like a baccistacrone, (however you spell it) which, in case you don't know, is the most efficient path that a ball rolling down a hill can take.

This has been bugging me for awhile and I don't know the calculus to prove it yet XD. A lot of my friends say it probably speeds up, but there's so many variables that would affect that.

If anyone is curious enough to work this one out, I'd be grateful!

"Basic university physics questions?Didn't realise there was a seperate community to r/Physics, so this question is on there too :) 

I have a few questions regarding the Doppler effect:

1. Is a doppler shift always symmetrical/asymmetrical? Could this relationship be graphed?
2. Why does the direction of blood flow not have a significant impact on the result from an ultrasound probe? We have been using the equation ∆f = (2fv/c) · cosθ

"HW Question about Lorentz' forceI disagree with the supposed answer of this question and would like your opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

The situation is as follows: (image)

[ zuidpool means south pole, noordpool means north pole.

There is a current through a coil, ABCD in the direction DCBA. The coil is in a homogenic magnetic field. This forms a Lorentz force in point P. The strength of this force is 1.6N

&amp;#x200B;

**The question is;** create a graph of how Fl on side CD changes in one turn of the coil.

&amp;#x200B;

Since Fl = BIl \* sin(alpha) I would assume that I get a sinusoide line.

[ according to the answer sheet this should be the answer:

[ the coil turns 45 degrees (0 &lt; sinus(45) &lt; 1) that would not result in a full force but somewhere in between. So I would assume that on time T1/8 there should not be a full force.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this answer sheet a simplified answer or do I misunderstand the laws.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",1
