"how to excel in a physics undergraduate degreethis post is for advice, i'm starting college next week and this college isn't my dream college, it doesn't have the best physics program, with most of the students just studying there to get a degree and then go for an mba or something. what would be your advice if you have experienced something similar? i at least want to get a master's degree too. do you know of anything helpful to distinguish yourself as a serious 'physics person' ?

"does pressure in a sealed container rise as it ascends in altitude?the source of this discussion is talking about inflating an inflatable stand up paddleboard at lower altitude and then driving it up to a mountain lake. these paddle boards have a stiff strong structure that holds their shape. they are designed to hold aprox. 15psi. if someone was to fill the paddleboard to 15psi say at 4,000ft altitude, then drive it to a mountain lake at say 8,000ft altitude, will the pressure in the paddleboard change from the change in altitude or is 15psi in a container, 15psi regardless of ambient pressure?",1

"measurement accuracy of the speed of lighti'm aware that the speed of light is defined to be 299792458 m/s, and that since 1983 the length of a meter has been defined with reference to that value.

according to wikipedia,

&gt;after centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be 299792458 m/s  \[...\] with a measurement uncertainty of 4 parts per billion.

this seems a small amount of uncertainty, but not necessarily so small that an improvement (say to 1 part per trillion) would be practically insignificant.

if measurements of the speed of light were to improve, such that scientists would (in theory) want to add a decimal place to the previous value of c and be confident that this was more accurate, then--unless they were to just ignore this result--according to si rules the length of a meter would have to change very slightly, in order to preserve the correctness of c = 299792458 m/s.

google hasn't enlightened me regarding whether, as of 2019, the speed of light has been measured more accurately than it was in 1975, or 1983. does anyone know whether this is the case, and if so whether the length of a meter has changed since then?",1

"'the persistent illusion of transience'hi all,

earlier today i listened to an interesting interview with alan moore. he mentioned his belief that all that happens in the universe is predetermined and recurs forever. he said that this accords with einstein's (source of the above quote) theory of the universe and also made the rather grand claim that 'most modern physicists' agree with him. is this true? 

my 'field' is philosophy and it struck me how similar this was to nietszche's eternal recurrence, which was also referenced by moore in the interview. that may be a useful point of comparison for my understanding of the topic if you have read any nietszche. 

my knowledge of physics is limited to having watched cosmos (i am aware that space-time is a thing) and high school physics so i wondered if someone with a bit more authority on the subject could help a brother out. links to reading much appreciated.

cheers!

p.s. i am up for discussing the possible impact of such a theory on moral philosophy if anyone is interested in that side of things. it has always struck me that the laws of science seem to be at loggerheads with our understanding of morality. how can we have free will if we know that all matter in the universe acts and interacts in accordance with certain rules?",1
"what are ways of conveying decibels into more graphable units (e.g. watts, joules)?so i'm doing an assignment where i have to conduct my own science experiment, and i've chosen to do one that relates to the law of conservation: i drop a golf ball and measure the volume of the impact, in decibels. the independent variable is the height from which i drop the ball. 

i'm already aware that different decibel measurements can't be graphed linearly that easy, since decibels work based on intensity (and stuff relating to how ears perceive sound), but i'm very sure that there's a way to demonstrate a linear trend from my results. 

all my measurements so far include:

* mass of the ball (having a ball means i don't have to worry about the way it lands when i drop it).

* distance from the decibel meter.

* ambient decibel levels (the environment). 

* heights from which the ball was dropped (of course).

* resulting decibel levels. 

so while i have lots of numbers written down, i'm not too sure what to do with these. the most legitimate formula i've seen and can use would be:

db = 10 x log10(w / 10^-12)

where db is the decibel level, w is the power of the sound wave (in watts) and 10^-12 is supposed to be the ""reference power"" (something about the atmosphere, also in watts). 

am i actually on the right track? if not, what are the correct formulas that i use?",1

"could physicists fact check this video for me? it's called ""quantum mechanics debunks materialism""[ video has almost 90,000 views and the comments are overwhelmingly positive. 

&amp;#x200b;

this video claims that: ""quantum mechanics conclusively debunks materialism and the notion of  there being an objective reality or physicality. these notions have been killed since the 1920s. reality is not material, not objective, and it  is not a linear rational clockwork machine..."" 

&amp;#x200b;

he also says this about quantum fields:

&gt; qm says that there are no such thing as particles (really). everything  is fields. a particle is really just a field. it is a cloud of  possibilities. when you look upon this cloud with some instrument or  with your own eyes or with your own consciousness what happens is that a  cloud congeals and collapses into a particular result. these fields are  interesting because mathematically a field is an infinite set of  scalars, so that means you take every single point in space and you put a  number on it that will be a field. \[...\] there’s a branch of science  called qft says that basically everything is a field and reality is an  interaction of different fields coming together, now, what’s interesting  about fields is its nothing but values but values of what? the answer  is nothing. there is nothing there, a field is infinite nothingness.  

&amp;#x200b;

also, at around 53 minutes, he uses an elephant as an example, and he says that according to qm: 

&gt;when you're not looking at an elephant, and this is just a metaphor, that elephant exists as every other animal that it could have possibly been. think about that and really think through the radical consequences of this, it's enormous. when you're not looking at an elephant, that elephant is literally infinite. it's every possible elephant that could ever possibly be that you could ever see or any other creature could see... not only that but it also exists as a kangaroo, as a chipmunk, as a rhinoceros... and then when you look at it it collapses down into that particular elephant that you see. that's a good metaphor for superposition.

&amp;#x200b;

he then says that when you drop your kid off at school, and you don't see them: ""that child exists as infinity, it's nothingness. when you 're not looking at the elephant it's infinity, it's nothingness.""

 

in the video he also replies to the objection that ""observers"" in physics doesn't have to be a conscious human, and that it could also be a laser or a detector, but he replies to this objection by saying that the laser and detectors and computers exist within your consciousness as well. 

&amp;#x200b;

i understand that this may seem out there, but i want to keep an open mind, and if this video is wrong, i want to know which claims specifically are wrong and why.

in the case that i'm right and it is not actually against the laws of physics, why is it always stated it is? it seems like something a physicist would not say is impossible, kind of like if you asked them if unicorns are possible, i think they would answer yes, even thought we don't know if they are, because it is not against the rules of physics. obviously this case is a bit different because it is impossible given everything in the universe, but we don't definitively know whats is beyond what we can see right? it is theoretically possible that there are trillions of more universes such as our own and that their could be ftl travel right? in the case i'm wrong, could anyone point me towards a good sources as to why we cant go ftl?

my understanding is that the higher the frequency, the lower the the piercing capabilities of said radio waves. my question is, is there an average value of degradation through common materials like a wall? or through air? i.e passing through a cinder brick wall, a 2.4ghz will degrade by x%, or 5ghz by y%, or traveling xm the radio wave loses z%.

"how do you prove that the summ of momentum of 2 objects in a closed system stays the same when both objects move and rotate?i wanted to program a simulation of 2 objects colliding, taking into account that they can rotate and that rotation and speed of the objects change before/after collision.
now i want to prove that the collision happened correctly, that my model works. just that i dont know how to do that, as i dont know how i can add up translation and rotation.

ps: a bit more about what my model is:
first off my objects are solid and are defined by mass, certain point array and moment of inertia .
currently i dont really care how and if the objects are colliding but rather how they get accelerated by springs. so when 2 objects collide , in my simulation its just 2 objects moving at each other and between a spring, the spring gets compressed,  acts a force on both objects which then gives the objects a certain force and certain torque, the objects get pushed away. if the center of mass of the objects are aligned with the spring, its just a normal conservation of linear momentum, but as soon as rotation comes into play i dont know how to prove that my model works. miss-aligned there is a case where both objects suddently move downwards and with spin, but then you would think that something has to move upward too so that linear momentum would conserve.

the spring itself is more a construct, it has no mass, and the exerted force is really just calculated by how much it is pressed together without boundaries as followed: f = k*d (f= force, k= constant i randomly appoint to fit my needs, d= distance how far the spring is pressed in (as in d = (length when relaxed) - (current length of the spring))) 

i have to say that my approach is fairly naive as i really just wanted to try to be able to simulate a so called collision even when the bodies can rotate and be able to include cases where for example an object rotates fast, hits another object as then the object accelerates but rotates slower. like linear and angular momentum are linked together but as i think it works is that angular momentum can be transferred to linear momentum right? i dont exactly know how that works and hope to be able to understand it better with a simulation, in case of only linear simulation it works. 

i apologize to not be able to shorten this and that this whole project is rather shaky but im thankful for everyone reading this, ""wasting their time"" and trying to help me.

right now, i am getting a bit tripped up about the scenario where a ball is rolling up an incline and not slipping.

&amp;#x200b;

when i draw the force body diagram, i believe that the normal force points upward, the force of gravity points down and to the left, and the frictional force points right (uphill). is it right to say that the frictional force must point uphill because the ball must spin clockwise to move to the right? i feel like this might be an incomplete answer.

&amp;#x200b;

additionally, why does the frictional force affect the force, but not the gravitational force? (more explanation into this question below)

&amp;#x200b;

my teacher has an example problem with a ball rolling up the hill, and the answer key looks like this:

&amp;#x200b;

sum(t) = i \* alpha

ff \* r = (2/5)\*r^(2) \* alpha

&amp;#x200b;

why does my teacher say that the force of friction is the force behind torque, instead of ff - fg? (so it would look like (ff - fg) \* r = (2/5)\*r^(2) \* alpha)

&amp;#x200b;

"time dilation in a 2 clock set-up
in the light clock thought experiment, alice (on the platform) and bob (on a train) are moving relative to each other. each are carrying 2 light clocks, oriented at a right angles to each other; one is oriented perpendicular to the x-axis, while the other is oriented perpendicular to the y-axis i.e. one perpendicular to the direction of motion and one in-line with the direction of motion.

from alice's perspective, on the platform shouldn't see the ""time"" speed up and then slowdown in one of bob's clocks - the clock that is perpendicular to the y-axis - while she will only see ""time"" slow down for the other clock - that is perpendicular to the direction of motion?

also, if the clocks are set up so that 2 of the mirrors are side-by-side i.e. the top mirror of the perpendicular-to-the x-axis-clock is beside the left mirror of the perpendicular-to-the y-axis-clock, and we imagine the photon in each clock starting from the opposite mirror. add to this that the clocks makes a click every time it reflects off a mirror.

in the rest frame of the clocks, the photons in each clock would arrive at the opposite mirror simultaneously combining to make one louder click, while according to the observer on the platform, the photons should not arrive in sync and should therefore make 2 distinct clicks.

is that correct?",1
"quantum mechanics and consciousnessi'm not going to pretend to be remotely acquainted with quantum mechanics beyond the soundbites scientists give for idiots like me to digest. however, i keep hearing people link the observation of a quantum phenomenon with its state of certainty. the way this is phrased seems to implicate human consciousness, but this strikes me as either (a) a dumb extrapolation on my part or (b) a dumbed-down phrasing. is the act of conscious observation of a particle legitimately implicated in it being in a certain or uncertain state? is ""observation"" here just describing whether or not a particle theoretically *could* be observed, regardless of whether it is(e.g. interacting with other particles in a way that would allow observation, if that's even how that works)?

i know that in a vacuum a hammer and a feather fall at the same speed.

on earth everything regardless of mass falls with a certain acceleration speed a and on mars everything falls with another acceleration speed b.

i don't understand how this can be true regardless of mass, because it leads to different results depending on the perspective if you use really immense masses.

okay, but what would happen if you dropped a feather and a hammer with the mass of earth onto mars? from the perspective of mars you would expect them both to accelerate at speed b

mars-hammer onto earth is the same scenario as earth-hammer onto mars, but you get two different results depending on which side you are looking at it from.

and if you had a hammer with the mass of the sun you would expect the earth to crash into it with immense speed, but ""a hammer and a feather fall just as fast"" would tell us otherwise.",1

"problem regarding special relativitythe following is given:

&gt;a particle in a system s has a total energy of 6 gev and a momentum of 4 gev/c. in a different system s' its momentum is 5 gev/c. what is the total energy of the particle in s' and what is the relative velocity of s' with regard to s.

the first questions is not problematic. given e\^2 = m\_0\^2 \* c\^4 + p\^2 \* c\^2 one can easily calculate that m\_0\^2 \* c\^4 = 20 (gev)\^2 and thus e' = sqrt(45) gev  ≈  6.7 gev.

when i tried to solve the second question i did the following:

the velocity of the particle in s can be calculated with e = (m\_0 \* c\^2)/sqrt(1 - v\^2/c\^2)  =&gt; v = (2/3) c.

similarly, the velocity of the particle in s' comes out to be v' = sqrt(5)/3 c.

knowing that v = (v' + u)/(1 + v'u / c\^2), where u is the the relative velocity between the systems, i calculated that u = (v - v')/(1-v'v/c\^2)  ≈  -0.156 c.

but according to the solution in the textbook, one can just assume that m'/m = e'/e = 6.7/6 = 1/sqrt(1-v\^2/c\^2) =&gt; v = 0.445 c. i don't really understand why my approach is wrong and why the v in the textbook solution is automatically the relative velocity of the systems. did i  make a wrong assumption, like that the velocity of the particle is parallel to the relative velocity?",1

"grade 11 physics - mechanical wavesi am having some confusion regarding mechanical waves. some of the wave reflects invertly when going from a less dense to more dense medium, or when a wave comes in contact with a fixed end. waves reflect upright when going from a more dense to a less dense medium, or when a wave comes in contact with a free end.

&amp;#x200b;

here is my confusion: aren't mechanical waves faster, the more dense the medium is?

in my answer key for my homework, when the wave is going from a high speed rope to a low speed chain, the wave is reflected inverted. and when the wave is going from a low speed chain to a high speed rope, the wave is reflected upright. i am confused.

if we follow what the question says, isn't a low speed chain a lesser dense medium, so since it has a lower speed, the wave should be reflected inverted when going from the low speed chain to the high speed rope? similarly, when going from a high speed rope to a low speed chain, shouldn't the wave be reflected upright?

based off what my answer key is saying, is the high speed rope the lesser dense medium, and the low speed chain the more dense medium, and why? does the behaviour of speed with regards to density change when it is in a rope?

i understand from a real world perspective, a chain is more dense than a rope, but this counteracts what i have been told in the question.",1

"making sense of carrier particleshi everybody. this is not exactly my field of study (i'm a phd student in chemistry), but i'm very fascinated by all aspects of physics, and i always like to have at least an intuitive understanding of every topic i come across. 

if i understand correctly, the modern interpretation of the 4 fundamental forces is that they are in essence caused by an exchange of particles (gluons, for example). this, to me, makes no sense at all. i see a particle exchange as a single event, a point in time, whereas the force experienced by two particles is something constant (for example, the idea of the gravitational force as a deformation in spacetime makes sense to me). furthermore, how does the information about interactions ""travel"" and get exchanged through these particles?

people usually say quantum mechanics does not make sense intuitively; personally, i disagree. quantum mechanics requires you to abandon your ""version"" of intuitive understanding; it requires you to realize that what you consider *obvious*, what makes sense immediately to you, is just a product of you being born and raised in an environment in which the physical laws assume a particular form (due to large masses in comparison to subatomic particles and small velocities in comparison to the speed of light). this is just to say that i believe there must exist an intuitive way to describe this idea of forces being exchanges of particles, and i kindly ask you to try and find it. :)",1
"what factors decide whether a plasma is generated from electric potential?context: i'm trying to build a diy sputtering rig. 
for anyone unfamiliar with the concept, sputtering deposits one material onto another. this is achieved by generating a plasma with high voltage, which bombards one electrode with ions, causing molecules to migrate from that end onto whatever it is you are sputtering onto.

i'm stuck on getting the plasma to form though. 

i have a glass chamber, which i pump out as much air as i can from, flush it with argon and repeat a couple of times. 

i then have a metal bottom lid and an insulated wire going to the top end of the glass jar. i have applied several different voltages to these electrodes, up to 25 kv, without getting a plasma to form. i keep getting either arcs or just a corona effect, but no full blown plasma.

i know some things about my rig could be better:
* i think a higher vacuum would be good. i've only measured it with a jury rigged meter, but i estimate it's probably around 0.2-0.3 bar. i can't do much about this right now though.
* the high voltage right now is a heavily offset ac. it could be seen mostly as a pulsed dc source though. 2-4 khz, ~15 kv, ~10-15 ma. this ought to suffice i think?

but the major thing i'm unsure of is the electrode shapes. as i mentioned, i am getting some corona effect on the top wire. is it important whether this electrode has a big area pointed toward the other electrode? i don't feel i have a good enough understanding of what determines if a plasma forms instead of an arc. or are they the same?",1

"illuminated lightbulb on lamp casts a shadow when using a flashlighti noticed if you shine a flashlight on an illuminated lightbulb in a lamp it will cast a shadow behind the lightbulb. is this shadow just a contrast to the surrounding brightness around the bulb or is the light from the flashlight illuminating the inside of the lightbulb of the lamp to make it white which reflects the other light and thus making a shadow? 

so whatever the case, you can pretty much direct light to cast a shadow behind another light. if that area behind the lamp bulb represented a 1 when illuminated and a 0 when there is a shadow, it is useful to have the ability to make that area dark without having to turn off the lamp but instead use light. 

i bet you could make a logic tree based on the speed between different lights and the shadows created along its travel. in computing you have the transistor to gate the signal but with the path of the light and another light you could simulate gating.

i guess a good experiment would be to take a standard 60w lightbulb and then put a pv cell where the shadow is cast and measure the output voltage. if there is any measurable difference in voltage then the concept is proved.",1

does the torque still equal to the product of the angular acceleration and the moment of inertia, or do i have to also take care of the gravitational acceleration trying to pull the cylinder to the ground?

**1. existence doesn't have many rules, but the few it has seem unbreakable.**

i'm aware of the distinction between ""rule"" and ""law"", but if the latter were used the wording could be condensed to ""existence has only a few laws"" and the intended contrast would not be expressed. anyway, there might be millions of them.


**2. complexity is not a matter of elements but relationships.**

it almost sounds like a trivial statement to me, but i'm not even certain if it's actually true. the word ""elements"" is meant to include the actual elements, but also particles, abstractions or any other discretely definable object.

"wave vector k -condensed matteri'm studying the module condensed matter (as an extra), with near-to-no knowledge of quantum mechanics. i can follow the class to an acceptable standard but there's one concept that is repeated throughout the course implementing the wave vector which i just can't wrap my head around.

&amp;#x200b;

the wave vector seems to produce a |sinusoidal| line on a plot of wave vector k (on x-axis) vs frequency (on y-axis) in relation to a chain of atoms in 1-dimension. why is the wave vector causing a maximum at an interval of pi/a (where a is spacing between atoms)?

i understand there is an absolute lack of information in this post, but i'm studying a module completely outside of my typical study and struggle to fully explain the situation. with understanding of why the wave vector has intervals of maximum and minimum on the plot and what it actually means would really help me progress through.

"force of an electromagnetthis is similar to another post about a month ago that someone else made( u/poker1059 ) but his question was never answered so hopefully someone can help this time around.

i have an old microwave oven transformer that i pulled the primary coil off of to create an electromagnet. i'm going to be using a bench power supply that supplies 12 volts with no current limiter. my multimeter says that the wire's resistance is .94 ohms. this puts the current running through the electromagnet at about 13.3 a. it's a dc electromagnet so it should follow ohm's law.

"problem in momentum(?) and collisions.the question goes as follows :

"" a ball is projected from the ground at a velocity v\_ball = 50 m/s inclined at an angle theta = 60 degrees to the +x-axis.  a wall is moving at a constant speed v\_ball = 5 m/s along the -x axis (opposite in direction to the ball). the ball collides with the wall, which has a coefficient of restitution of e =0.7, and bounces back to fall to the ground. where does the ball hit the ground after collision if :

1. it collides at y = maximum height of the projectile,
2. it collides at y = half the maximum height of the projectile
3. it collides at an instant where its velocity = v\_ball/2

**you may not use the equation of trajectory.** (the parabola equation relating the y- and x- coordinates) ""

i tried taking the velocities to the frame of the wall, but the second equation required to solve this doesn't seem to strike me. also, we are not given the masses of the two bodies and the answer is expected to be numeric.

&amp;#x200b;

what i have recognised so far:

* the wall being there only affects the horizontal component of velocity.
* in part 1) the vertical component of v = 0.
* in the frame of the center of mass of the system, relative velocity of separation = e(relative velocity of approach)",1

no one has been able to make ends of the solution we were provided with for this question:

a beam of spin-1 particles, moving along the y axis, is incident on two collinear sg apparatuses, the first with b feild along the z axis and the second with b along the z' axis, which lies in the xz plane at an angle `$\theta$` relative to the z axis. both apparatuses transmit only the uppermost beams. what fraction leaving the first will pass the second?

&amp;#x200b;

the solution given: 

particles exciting the first filter will be in the (1, 0, 0)\^t (transpose)  state (s(z) basis). particles passing the filter will be in the eigenstate of the `$b \cdot s$`  opperator, which is = b(cos \* s(z) + sin \* s(x))  (which becomes a matrix of cos and sin). 

the solution then states that the spin up eigen vector is 1/2(1+cos, sqrt(2) sin, 1-cos). 

then the inner product \^2 of this with the spin up z basis vector is  1/4 (1+cos(theta))\^2.

"problems with a simulated universei recently watched a video made by pbs spacetime about how to simulate the entire universe. (  ) basically you can simulate every particle in the universe within a black holes event horizon roughly the size of sagittarius a, and this same black hole could compute every computation the universe has done in 13 billion years, in 5 minutes. but i see some problems with this.

1) does this black hole require every particle in the universe, to simulate every particle? so, how does anyone maintain it?

2) if the universe can be simulated in a smaller space, then the simulated universe can simulate itself in an even smaller space, and it goes on forever. this means the universe has infinite computation power. 

3) if the black hole can computate what the universe has done in 5 minutes, can't it predict the future? 

this all seems paradoxical, so surely to simulate the entire universe, it must require either the same or more space and take the same or more time, right?",1

but this can't mean that the speed of the other car is completely irrelevant right? if we keep the first car's speed the same, what if the second car is traveling at 25 mph? or 100 mph? i'd assume the accident is worse when the other car is traveling at 100 mph. but if both cars having equal speed and one object being stationary are identical, then i can't figure out how to logic through 25 mph being any different then those two answers.

[here are the ponderings]( that got me to the equation.  i didn't actually have it in mind when i started writing, it just developed as part of the process.  i did however, do a lot of searching for ""mass of the universe"", ""density of the universe"",  ""volume of the universe"" and so on to make sure that my results were within the ballpark and i never saw anything like this equation.

is **m =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2g** a recognised relationship?

pps - (post edit) i've very slightly edited the text above, but i can't do anything about the title.  there's some sort of age of the universe and mass relationship, but it's possible that ""mass of the universe"" was poorly worded (as was mass of the (observable) universe).  i should have been more careful and said ""mass inside a sphere whose radius is the hubble length"".  i did get the equation via a consideration of the volume of the observable universe (and a volume associated with a sphere with the radius equal to the schwarzschild radius in which the density is equal to the current critical density of our universe) but i have since noted that i should have been thinking of something that i've called a ""light horizon"" but could also be called a ""hubble length sphere"" using wording from sean carroll.  i've also tightened my wording at the linked article.

ppps - (post edit of edit) nope, ""mass of the (observable) universe"" doesn't work either - edited to reflect.  i still think there's something interesting, but i'm thinking that it might already be understood but i have approached it from such an oblique angle that some experts can't see that i am talking about the bleeding obvious as if it were arcane.  clearly not being an expert means i can't see the bleeding obvious or put into words why what i am looking at is bleeding obvious :)  or the critical density having an apparent relationship with the age of the universe could just be no more than apparent after all and, if so, any conclusions drawn from it would likely be wrong.",1

"request for feedback: the atemporal universe - resolving the problem of timei've written (or at least tried to write) a paper on the problem of time. it's a  philosophy of physics paper. any feedback (preferably constructive 😁) would be greatly appreciated. a critique of the ideas is of primary interest, but i know the formatting and structure need a lot of work too. anyway, here is the abstract from the paper:

this paper looks at a possible resolution of the “problem of time” which arises from the attempt to unify quantum mechanics (qm) and general relativity (gr), into a theory of quantum gravity. extending the principle of relativity to the concepts of synchronisation and simultaneity, in einsteinian relativity allows for the restoration of absolute simultaneity, which in turn helps to align the concepts of time in gr and qm. a further a change in perspective, as to how time is viewed in physics, shows how time is neither fundamental nor emergent, but is rather a defined system of measurement. this is in the same sense that the metric system [of measurement] - or indeed any other system of measurement - is neither fundamental nor emergent. this is to say that the universe is fundamentally atemporal or “timeless”. in viewing time as a system of measurement, we retain all the functional attributes that are currently attributed to time, in our contemporary physical theories. a relational interpretation of time is retained at the classical level, which can make sense of both the leibnizian and machian principles of time, while such a timeless interpretation is indistinguishable from the idea of absolute time. the reinterpretation of “time” as nothing more than a system of measurement also helps to address the issue of background dependence, which is part of the overall problem of arriving at a unified theory of quantum gravity. this paper also seeks to address the issue of background independence, albeit less directly.

"physics 1 - am i doing this final velocity problem correctly(they want the velocity with an angle)?something with a mass of 1700 kilograms moves with the initial velocity +13 m/s in the x direction. -29,000n in the y direction is exerted on it for 0.37 seconds.

i found the acceleration in the y direction:

f = ma

-29,000n = 1700kg * a

a = (-29000 kg m/s^2 ) /(1700kg)

= -17.1 m/s^2 

then i found the velocity in the y direction:

velocity = -17.1 m/s^2 * 0.037s

= -6.31 m/s

then i added the 2 vectors together and solved for the velocity using pythagorean theorem

vf = sqrt[(13 m/s)^2 + (-6.31 m/s)^2 ]

= 14 m/s

i then found the angle by doing 

tan theta = -6.31 m/s / 13 m/s

theta = tan^-1 (-6.31 m/s / 13 m/s)

theta = -26 degrees

so i said the final velocity = 14 m/s east 26 degrees south

"rod structural bending failure - hand calcsthis a pretty specific problem, not a hw problem but just theoretical (kind of connected to a personal project). not sure if it fits here, but i'll try. sorry for the poor formatting, done from mobile.

i just did hand calcs for theoretical bending failure of an aluminum rod, and i'm just looking to double check believing my results match reality.

so the parameters of the problem in question:
a 1/4"" al-6360 rod supporting a 1lb load 1m away.

made some simplifications to get:

f = 1 lbf ~= **5n**

l = **1m**

r (radius of rod) = 1/8in = **3.175e-3m**

tensile yield strength = **214mpa**


---------------------------
so, my calculations:

m = l x f = **5 nm**

i = (pi x r^4 ) / 4 = **7.981e-11 m^4**

max bending stress = (m x r)/i = **199mpa**

so, what i get from these calculations is that an approximately 1 lb mass at a 1m cantilever distance from the mounting point will cause a 1/4"" al rod to approach permanent deformation.

i know the question seems pretty random, but i haven't done much applied structural analysis in the past, so i chose numbers like 1 lb and 1 m that i can easily estimate in reality. so, are my calculations and conclusion correct?",1

"change in the content of a solution based on influx - calculate content of the influx?hi everyone,

&amp;#x200b;

i'm sorry for the rather unhelpful title - i'm currently working on a metabolism model as part of a research project, however, hit a problem i am not really capable of solving on my own.

i am measuring the ratio of a set of compounds (a, b and c) in a solution at different time points. the absolute concentration of all of those compounds increases over time due to a constant influx - what i am interested in is what the ratio is in the influx, if that makes sense? the ratio in the influx will start at 100% a, and change over time to a constant, but different ratio - we assume that the majority of our time points captures this stable phase. 

to add a bit more information, what i am looking at are not different compounds, but different versions of the same compounds, differing only in their isotopic composition. the alternative to this approach would be to fully quantitate the different compounds in the influx, but i am somewhat worried about the reliability of this approach in our case.

"year 12 physics advice/tips/important formulas/anything i may be missing on motion?with physics in school, i'm currently doing a sac. the sac involves two parts, each part relating to a single practical experiment. 

the first experiment was basically a string attached to two masses, a 50g cork on one side, and a 50g weight hanger on the other. a tube with a paper clip was attached to a known radius of the string. it then involved spinning the upper part of the string with the cork, horizontal motion. then the amount of time for 30 revolutions, and after that adding more weight to the hanger and repeating.

i already did the first part of the sac, don't think i did well. i had to calculate centrifugal force, had no idea how to get the velocity but on my paper it said g=9.8m/s/s, so i used gravity as acceleration to calculate velocity. (which i have the feeling wasn't correct) t (period) and frequency also had to be calculated. i divided 30 by the amount of time it took for t, and then divided from 1 for frequency. those results had to then be showed in a centrifugal force vs frequency graph, with questions like what did the results show between fc and freq, (i simply wrote freq decreases as fc increases or something like that) were the disrepancies in results and why (unanswered) and i think something about tension? a second graph had to be drawn showing fc and freq^2 and a couple more questions for that one. 

i'm feeling i'm at risk of failing, so i want to get prepared for the next part as much as possible. the 2nd prac involved a ramp in 
which a marble was put on to fall down. the time it took for the marble to hit the ground, and a general measure of where it landed were recorded. the ramp's height was changed, the angle was unknown. since the 2nd part is based on this, what are things i should know, specific topics on motion i should study and any formulas that will definitely be important?",1

where p, q and p’, q’ are the momentum 4-vecotrs before and after the collision respectively. the initial 4-vectors are: p = m(c, v), q = m(c, 0). i think the final ones would be, p’ = 0 (since the proton is part of the nucleus) and q = m\*(c, u) where m\* = m + m and u is the velocity of the new nucleus. i only obtain 1.2461c which obviously isn’t possible. here’s where i’m stuck

"how common is it to have publications as an undergrad?hello r/askphysics! 

i’m an undergraduate physics student, and just got my first research position this summer. as the title states, i’m wondering how common it is for physics undergrads to have publications under their belts when applying for grad school.


i ask because i’m slowly understanding how much work goes into getting publishable results. we don’t even know if the results will be publishable yet, and in the best case scenario where they are, writing a paper will take a *long* time. especially since i would be writing it during the semester while taking classes, and it’s only me and my pi working on this project.


i’m freaking out a little because when browsing subreddits about grad admissions, some people are like “oh yeah, i have three publications, one first author” and etc. if one project takes like two years, that just doesn’t seem feasible to me??

"is this a good explanation of where the energy is fission and fusion comes from?howdy all, 

i have tried to conceptualize the fission/fusiion process for a long time and have struggled with the traditional binding energy curve explanation you get in textbooks. the below is what icame up with...does it seem accurate/correct to you?

-----------------

i’m sure you have heard of albert einstein’s famous equation e=mc2; you may have even known it was related to nuclear engineering but not known how. what this equation means is that mass is related to energy and energy is related to mass and that it is possible for one to be expressed as the other.


for example as subatomic particles accelerate close to the speed of light (high energy) their mass actually increases tremendously as a direct result of the energy the particle has. that is why particle accelerators (think cern) have to be so massive to get that extra little push in speed for such tiny particles. (sadly it is also why we will never be able to travel as fast as light. (although bending space to effectively go faster than light may be possible.) energy can be measured as mass and mass can be measured as energy interchangeably. in a loose sense, one can think of energy as having mass.


okay, now this next part is probably the most intense part of the book, but it is crucial so please read carefully!


it may seem counterintuitive, however the sum of the individual parts of an atom always weigh slightly more than the complete bounded atom. thus, counter to the old addage, atoms “weigh less than the sum of their parts”. the reason for this is because individual unbound nucleons floating in space have a potential energy with respect to every other nucleon or nucleus created by the strong nuclear force. when nucleons are separated and unbound it is like a ball floating in the air. the ball has potential energy due to gravity compared to the surface of the earth. when the ball falls to the ground it looses that energy just as a nucleon looses energy when it “falls” into and binds with another nucleon or nucleus. 


according to the laws of energy conservation you probably leanred in high school physics, energy must be released in order for there to be an inelastic colission (i.e. where the two objects stick together). for example, two clumps of clay will deform or a falling plate will shatter and make noise. the potential energy has to be disipaited somehow or else the object cannot stay at the lower energy state and will rebound to some degree. the same is true for unbound nucleons. the energy from the binding must be released since the nucleons are going from a higher unbound energy state to a lower bound energy state. as shown with e=mc2 discussed above, that change in energy is reflected as a change in mass known as the “mass deficit” or “binding energy”, the amount of energy released by forming the atom. what is incredible is that this change in mass is real and actually measurable. 


this explains why energy is released when smaller nuclei are fused together in the fusion process. two smaller unbound nuclei are fused together and release the stored potential energy between them in the process. 

now at this point you may be wondering how it is possible that putting smaller nuclei together can release energy in the fusion process but breaking apart large nuclei into smaller components can also release energy in the fission process. in actuality, putting smaller parts together always releases energy even in the case of larger nuclei. however, unlike smaller nuclei in the fusion process, the large nuclei involved in nuclear fission have a tremendous amount of potential energy resulting from the electromagnetic repulsion of the protons in the nucleus. when energy is put back into the system via a high energy neutron, the nucleus deforms to the point where the strong force is no longer strong enough to hold the atoms together and the atom explodes due to the electrostatic repulsion caused by the protons. 


in a sense, in fission the energy is the result of the released electrostatic repulsion of the protons (i.e. electrostatic force), whereas in fusion the energy released is due to the loss of potential energy between unbound nucleons (i.e. a result of the strong nuclear force). just as in the fusion process, uranium atoms also released energy when they were formed eons ago in the center of a star, however that is not what is being harvested in the fission process. 


this explains why so much more energy is released by fusion as oppossed to fission. the nuclear strong force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force (as discussed earlier this is why atoms stay together) so releasing potential energy between nucleons due to binding releases much more energy than that which is released when at large atom explodes due to stored electrostatic repulsion caused by protons.",1

"what was wrong with my thought process? (i dont need you to explain me the math, just the logic) 

i dont need you to explain me how to solve the following question, because i i already know that i can use the x - xo = vot + (at\^2)/2 formula to solve it; my problem is that i dont know why i can't use a=δv/δt instead. so, to the question:

""an object moving with uniform acceleration has a velocity of 12.0 cm/s in the positive x direction when its x coordinate is 3.00 cm. if its x coordinate 2.00 s later is 5.00 cm, what is its acceleration?""

&amp;#x200b;

the thing is, my thought process was: if the acceleration is equal to δv/δt, then i need to find the second velocity (the first is given, which is 12cm/s). so, i tried to find the second velocity by doing v=δs/δt, which is = 5-3/2-0, which ended up being 2/2, which was equal to 1cm/s. once i found that, i tried to find the acceleration by doing a=δv/δt. the first acceleration is 12m/s and the last was 1m/s, and the time was 2 seconds. so i did a= 1-12/2-0, therefore a= -5,5m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200b;

the answer, however, is -11m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200b;

so what was wrong in my thought process? is it because if a is constant, then i must assume that it is not equal to δv/δt ? if so, why is that? if not that, is it because a=δv/δt means only average acceleration and i must assume that if a is constant, then it must be instantaneous acceleration? if so, why? (lol, sorry for the bunch of questions.).

&amp;#x200b;

also, can i, instead of giving that answer, just maintain what i did, and just change it at the end, putting a= 1-12 = -11cm/s\^2 instead of a= 1-12/2-0? if so, is it because im supposed to ignore the time somehow or what? and if thats the case, why is that?

general principle of relativity (gpr): the fundamental laws of physics are the same in all frames of reference.

i’m having a bit of a hard time understanding the distinction between the two. my current interpretation of the matter is:

sep is saying that you can “pretend” your frame of reference is subject to fictitious forces (thinking in classical terms) arising from the fact that it is non-inertial (hence the need for locality, because fictitious acceleration would be constant throughout space).

gpr is saying that you can explain all fictitious forces as gravitational fields, which seems to be an equivalent statement to the previous.

"ultrasound physics, attenuation coefficienthello, just a small question.

a pulse of frequency *f* (mhz) is emitted into a material with attenuation coefficient *a* (db/cm/mhz). if the pulse travels a distance *d* (cm) then i have to find the loss.

the answer finds it simply by saying that loss = *a\*f\*d* (db).

sure the units work out, but shouldn't we use the equations for loss and intensity? equations :

*loss* (db) *= 10\*log(i / i\_0)* where *i / i\_0 =  exp(-μ\*d)*

i presumed that *μ* (db/cm) = *a* (db/cm/mhz) *\* f* (mhz) because the exponential must have units of db

i will be a junior this fall, but i decided to change my major to chemistry this past semester (from a non-science major) as i developed an interest in understanding more about how the world works. i took calculus i and general chemistry i, and am currently taking general chemistry ii as a summer class.

i find chemistry fascinating and enjoy understanding how matter interacts and changes form. yet, i noticed that i am more drawn to the areas of chemistry that share more in common with physics, such as electrochemistry, nuclear chemistry, and thermodynamics. i like that physics encompasses more than the scope of chemistry, including topics like mechanics, optics, and electricity and magnetism. i also enjoy the fundamentals of physics concepts and how they explain natural phenomenon. i like mathematics and would enjoy the challenge of applying calculus to solve physics problems.

"can i get some help understanding spacetime and velocity as relating to the 2nd law of thermodynamics?so as i understand it (at least in the minkowski model), we are always moving at the speed of light through spacetime. if you increase your velocity through space, you decrease your velocity through time. because of this, if you move 2 clocks through space, one significantly faster than the other, then when you bring them back together, it turns out that the clock that moved faster is a little behind the other. motion relativity effects between objects moving significantly slower than the speed of light, then, are pretty much just another layer of relativity on top of this. in addition, the speed of light is a universal speed limit. but, theoretically, if you could move faster than light, you'd be reversing causality or going backward in time in some way, or something along those lines. these are my assumptions coming in to this.

anyway, this brings me to my questions.

first, if it's impossible for an ""object"" (you know, like, something that's not a wave/particle with a velocity of c) to actually achieve the speed of light in space, does that mean the same object also can not fully stop moving? there's probably a temptation here to respond by saying ""stop moving relative to what?"" so to clarify, i mean stop moving in the sense that your velocity ""on the space axis"" in the minkowski model is zero. the reason i ask is that if it's impossible to achieve zero on the time axis and c on the space axis, shouldn't it also be impossible to achieve zero on the space axis and c on the time axis? and if it is possible to stop moving on the space axis, why is that? (given that you can't stop moving on the time axis)

then the second question is this: whenever i ask the internet, ""why does time only move forward"" or ""why do objects all move the same direction through time"" or some variation on that question, the answer always seems to be ""because the 2nd law of thermodynamics dictates that the universe must move from a more ordered state to a state of more entropy, therefore you can't unmix a cup of coffee and milk."" but this seems to me to be a truism, or in other words, an answer that doesn't do anything more than describe the question in a different way. it just begs the new question, why does everything move from order to chaos? if we go back to the minkowski model, it would seem that in a universe moving toward a state of total entropy, all objects would simply be reducing their velocity on the space axis and increasing their velocity on the time axis. so i find myself unable to conceptualize any actual relationship between entropy and time at all. is there actually a relationship there i don't understand? or can somebody explain why everything seems to move forward in time without using the 2nd law of thermodynamics as an answer?",1

the given information is the x,y position of the balls (centers), their radius, mass, velocities (magnitudes and components), and angle of travel.   


if it helps, i'd be glad to share the relevant code or post a link to a video of the program running to show the issue.",1

wouldn't the tip have more velocity and thus more kinetic energy?

or does it have to do with center of mass somehow?",1
"question about particlesso, i have a friend who, isn't very into science. he, for some reason simply doesn't believe in particles (so, bigger things like atoms, aswell as things like leptons, quark etc). i've tried debating with him, using photosynthesis and chemical reactions as proof for particles but he says that it could all just be explained by matter, matter is all there is. wood for example isn't made of particles and even at its most fundamental level is just wood. is there any way to prove to him that matter simply can't exist without particles?",1
"how does a force always acting upon an object, like gravity, work?sorry for the stupid question.

if i ignore all other factors, an object thrown into the air should keep on going up forever. gravity, however, pulls that object down.

if those two forces are acting upon an object, how would i subtract them? how would i get how high the object will go before it starts falling down?

i have a problem with quantifying forces on a given object.  i may have been making too many assumptions to simplify the problem so if we need to make some other assumptions or need more information i can try to provide.

picture of problem:
 i have an object that is 537"" long, with a center of gravity known that is 'off center' at 270"" and the object weighs 10,126 lbs.  i have 3 lifting points on the object at 48"", 161"" and 507"" from the left edge.  i want to find out how much force is being exerted on the 3 points.  the curveball is that there may be more lifting points added (up to 5). 

my initial issue is that i think that this is statically underdetermined, and i cannot figure out a way to make it...determined.

"relativistic momentum collision using 4-vectors hello, i'm doing a problem in special relativity and i've come across a 3 object momentum collision, but i'm struggling to answer it appropriately, here's the problem:  for part i), for before the collision, i get the following 3 4-momenta: 

for the asteroid with mass m0 (0,0,0,0)

for the asteroid with mass m moving in +ve x: (e1/c, mv1y1,0,0)

for the asteroid with mass m moving in -ve x: (e2/c, -mv2y2,0,0)

where y1/y2 are the lorentz factors for each asteroid. 

for the final momenta i get the two following results:

(e1/c , mv * y * cos(theta), m v * y * sin(theta),0,0)

(e2/c, mv * y * cos(theta), -mv * y * sin(theta),0,0)

this seems fine, they'll both have the same gamma factor moving with the same v, so they have the same y above. the cosine components are the same, but the sin components are opposite signed.

for part ii) i can't figure out how to get this result, if i equate the x-components, i 

1) get a factor of cosine which i can't get rid of

2) get v1 and v2 in the expression 

3) cant use m0 straight away because initially m0 has no momentum

part iii) and iv) are easy enough because i can just use the expression given, but part ii) makes me think i got my 4-vectors wrong?

any help hugely appreciated

"what was the most difficult subject for you during the undergraduate?just out of curiosity.

there are four main subjects when it comes to physics curriculum..

&amp;#x200b;

classical mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics.

&amp;#x200b;

among the four of them i found statistical mechanics(or, equivalently, thermal physics) to be the hardest one. i actually didn't know why i had to derive maxwell's identity, free energy, gibbs free energy, and something else. so many variables that i'm not sure which variable to choose to describe which system. i think it can depend on what textbook is used during the curriculum.

&amp;#x200b;

i used marion and thornton for cm(5th edition) during the second year. i should have grasped thorough knowledge of linear algebra by the time i went through moment of inertia. i didn't know why i had to get eigenvalues of the tensor back then. but this is a clearly a good book cause it helps to connect classical concepts to quantum mechanics and contains a lot of great problems too.

&amp;#x200b;

griffiths for em. it was really helpful to understand how to use vector analysis / calculus. and quite a lot of good problems from the easiest ones to challenging ones. clear explanation. i also found wangsness's em was really great too. i used it as a reference cause griffiths didn't get deep down in certain topics. wangsness basically covers everything to prepare you for jackson.

is it possible to pick out a point in space and never move from that point/spot?

*actually question 2: *

a.) moving automatically from your point of origin?

b.) not moving from your point of origin?

c.) this question does not make sense because you'd need to be located relative from some other ""thing"" in order to have a point of origin?",1

"moving a mermaidi'm no physicist or someone looking to become one. i just have a physics puzzle in front of me and i don't know what to google to answer the question for myself. 

for context, i'm a theatre student who is working on a performance project. i've been really inspired by mermaids recently (thank you #mermay) and had the fleeting idea of how much of a statement it would be to be wheeled onstage submerged in a large container of water, and then ""gasp"" out, emerging with all the grace of a dying fish. art. but i'm well aware of how impractical that would probably turn out to be in rolling out a container strong enough and large enough to hold me and however much water. still, it was a fun visual.

that did get me curious though. from what i understand, buoyancy helps reduce the amount of force needed to move an object through water. but does that reduction of work matter at all if you're also moving the water?

for instance, say a neutrally-buoyant ball (or is it more fun to imagine a mermaid?) weighs x grams, and a bucket of water weights y grams. ifyou put that ball into the bucket of water and then apply force to the side of the bucket, do you have to apply as much force as it would take to move those two weights, x and y, cuminatively? or does the buoyancy of the ball help reduce the amount of energy needed at all? does the answer change if the ball is more negatively or more positively bouyant?

"how do you approach your studies?i suppose this is more of a ""meta"" question rather than a specific physics problem, but i hope it can still have a place here and maybe let me come away with some helpful tips.

i'm having a really hard time studying physics (undergraduate, 4th semester) because it feels so incredibly unrewarding to do so. this issue is not helped by the fact that i do not have any physics related end goal, that physics degree is just going to serve as insurance for a very distant period of my life where i will settle down and my objectives change. for now, i just wish i could do something else. now that i've managed to come this far i should get this thing over the finish line, though.

so that's why i am here. i want to find out how you guys approach studying and how do you set yourself goals that feel achievable and rewarding on a short-term basis? i am currently tackling quantum mechanics and i've never felt so unsatisfied. i chose to study physics because i'm curious about how things work. but at university level that doesn't come easily. when i read a script or book, i understand nothing on the deepest level. in order to truly grasp it in its entirety i would sit for hours on a single page, looking up and understand the concept behind every single word that i didn't know and re-calculating every equation to fully understand the steps from start to finish. and then i finally feel like having a crack at the problem set and realize i get none of it. fantastic! now i don't put in the effort to do this. feeling like an idiot and working hard for an entire day just to maybe at the end of it come out being a tiny step closer to understanding some part of physics sucks really damn hard.

is this really how responsible, hard working students approach their studies? in that case i'm in the wrong place. i mean, in that case it's also kinda cool that i came so far with my pathetic work ethic, but surely there must be ways to make studying feel more meaningful and rewarding on a short-term scale. when i work for an hour my brain goes ""ding! another hour completed, money in the bank."", when i study physics for an hour my brain goes ""what is this crap? oh man, i thought i'm smart. i actually know nothing. knowing anything would require lifetime devotion to the subject. get me out of here!"".

"ucsb or uci for undergraduate physics?i just finished my second year as a physics major at a uc and i’ve been accepted to uc irvine and uc santa barbara for physics as a third year transfer. i’m having a tough choice between the two universities and tldr i just feel that academically, ucsb would be the better choice but i would enjoy being at uci more. 

i want to go to grad school when i finish my bachelors at one of these two schools so i know that research opportunity is a big factor when i comes to being a strong applicant. currently i have 0 research experience (yeah i’m behind) but academically i’ve been at the top of my classes (have good relationships with all my physics professors so far  i would say and have asked for letters of rec) and have a 3.8 gpa so i would say if i add in some research experience within these two upcoming years, i would have really good chances of getting into a top school. 
i’m not sure which specific area of physics yet, but i’m hoping i would be certain on one soon.

so i know that ucsb is known to have one of the best physics programs (#2 public university in ca, right behind ucb) so ucsb is pretty respected among the “physics world.” i know that uci has a great physics program as well, but when it comes down to it, does the undergrad university matter? do grad schools take it as a huge factor when considering an applicant? i heard that students in the college of creative studies have high chances of getting into a good grad school because they are well prepped, so i was looking forward to the program. however, i also heard that they don’t care much for transfer students and it’s hard for transfer students to be admitted into ccs. does anybody have more info on this?

i visited both ucsb and uci this week and here’s what i thought of it (please don’t think i’m disrespecting either campus because both are really good campuses and this is just my personal take on it)

when i first got to ucsb, i saw a lot of people walking around and immediately saw the chill vibe of the area. but i don’t like the surrounding college town, isla vista. i’ve heard about how the landlords are super bad and the housing is overpriced for the small space you get. don’t get me wrong, i’m into the party scene but it’s just not a big factor i feel like i need. i’m more into partying with friends rather than huge blowouts with strangers. the reason i don’t like it is because it’s pretty messy and dirty. i like working from home and a clean working space is a high priority to me. i envy the students here who are able to balance everything but i feel that if i try hard enough i can get it done as well. i also feel like the buildings are a bit old but the campus overall is alright. however, the building for the college of creative studies is a run down yellow box and the the building that says physics on it (i think it’s offices and labs for grad students) looks like a jail inside. but other than that, the modern side of the library, the physical science building and the engineering buildings are beautiful. i also know that ucsb has the kavli institute of theoretical physics but as an undergrad does that matter much?(aside from sitting in on seminars from physicists that are here for that resource of course). the side by the lagoon is also beautiful and i really liked it. another thing i liked was that the beach is next to the school so i can see why a lot of people says ucsb is gorgeous. i’m not a big fan of downtown as well. it’s an okay city with some alright food places but i personally love asian cuisine and i didn’t find any great boba or pho/noodle spots (i’m sure there are some outside of goleta).

when i first got to uci i was amazed at how different it is compared to ucsb. it’s almost a complete flip. the nature and beach was swapped for an extremely clean city with not much of a sense of close community like isla vista. i thought the campus itself was also okay but what stood out to me was how close everything is. there’s a little plaza with target, trader joe’s, chick fil a etc. literally next to campus. also the park in the middle of campus seems like a peaceful area (i didn’t like how hilly the inner campus is though). the best thing about going to uci is that one of my close friends who goes there right now is looking for a housemate for a house 10 min walking distance from campus (so i don’t have to worry about housing). i also know a lot of people who go there but i don’t think this is a big deal because college is about making new friends and forming new connections. but i feel that it should be said because that’s why i’m more certain i will have a better time at uci. another big thing is that la and sd is 1-2hrs away + more food areas. the down sides are that the party life, nightlife, and the physics isn’t as strong as compared to ucsb. however my intuition led me to think this: uci is still a research university with a lot of resources related to physics. wouldn’t it be easier to gain research experience here compared to ucsb since not many come to uci for the physics major? idk just a thought, might be wrong. 

i think the biggest factors influencing my decision are: how well i think i will do in academics, how much research i can get done, and how much i will enjoy the overall experience. please comment and share any insight you have in what i should take account of or any advice in general!",1

firstly, sorry for my ignorance, i just graduated high-school and my knowledge in physics is limited to the very basic level of a few subjects that i've learned in school.

so i've finished high-school physics about a week ago and one of the subjects were electromagnetism. we learned about the magnetic field, how it's created and how it affects charged particles or any electric current (which is obviously many charged particles, so it makes sense).

i know one definition of a field (electric, magnetic, gravitational,  etc), which is that if you're in the field and you fit a certain requirement (have a mass for gravitational, have a charge for electric, and have a moving charge(?) for magnetic) it applies force on you (we learned newtonian physics so force is a key word).

the thing is, i know that magnetic fields don't only apply force on moving charged particles, as they affect most metals, so what is the requirement for a magnetic field to apply force on you (apart from moving charge)?

i've tried googling this but weirdly didn't find any answers, i'm sure that i just haven't dug far enough, but i'm sure that a personal answer to my question will be the most effective!

 ""flotation  
flotation introduces gas bubbles to enhance oil removal. the gas bubbles attach to the oil droplets to increase the rise rate of the oil. various flotation methods such as dissolved gas flotation (dgf), dissolved air flotation (daf), and induced gas flotation (igf) may be used. typically this separation step is used following a primary oil–water separation step which is able to remove a large portion of the free oil.""

 ""electrochemical

wastewater purification of oils and contaminates by electrochemical emulsification is actively in research and development. electrochemical emulsification involves the generation of electrolytic bubbles that attract pollutants such as sludge and carry them to the top of the treatment chamber. once at the top of the treatment chamber the oil and other pollutants are transferred to a waste oil tank""

"bird i'm truck(a really really big truck)so i presume everyone knows the scenario where there are birds in truck, and if they take flight the truck does/doesn't get lighter. 

i like to imagine the air as spheres hence i can visualize the air hitting the truck floor and exerting force on it.

but what if? the truck were, let's say, 10 kms high, perfectly sealed, and made from something so that it has all the properties of the normal truck, and weighs the same as the normal truck. 

for some reason now when i imagine the balls, i see them as getting bluer(they were red before). because when they get pushed they start colliding with each other, so that makes them warmer but there is so much air and surface of the truck that it radiates away. so could it be that the kinetic energy that the birds exert on the air in order to stay up, transforms to heat energy and then it gets radiated out, and by the time it reaches the truck floor is nothing left?

"i tried to calculate the distance to the alien's homeworld (and the acceleration of their ships) in ""childhood's end"" by arthur c. clarke. did i do this right? if so, how can i get more information?the alien race in childhood's end are called ""the overlords,"" and at various points throughout the book he gives hints regarding their location and technology.  he mentions early on that their ships take ""about an hour"" to reach maximum acceleration,  the overlords ""would age only four months on the round trip [from their planet to earth], but when they returned their friends would be eighty years older.""

so to get the average velocity on the round trip, i would need:

t = t0 / (sqrt (1 - (v/c)^2))

4 months = 1.051 *10^7 seconds.
80 years = 2.523 * 10^9 seconds.

solve for v:

2.523 * 10^9 seconds = 1.051 *10^7 seconds / (sqrt (1-(v/c)^2)

(1.051 *10^7 seconds/ 2.523 * 10^9 seconds)^2 = 1 - (v/c)^2

1.735*10^(-5) + (v/c)^2 = 1

(v/c) = sqrt (1-1.735*10^(-5) ) = 0.999991325

v = (0.99999132496) * (299 792 458 m / s) = 299,789,857 m/s average velocity.

299,789,857 m/s  * (80 years in seconds) = 7.585*10^17 meters = 80.17 light years (round trip)

hence, the overlords' planet is ~40.085 light years away (supposedly in the constellation carina).


it supposedly took the overlords ""about an hour"" to accelerate their ships to these speeds (g-force compensators were mentioned).  the simple way to do this would simply be to divide the speed of light by an hour and call that a rough approximation of the acceleration.

however, the ""about an hour"" figure comes from the time measured *on the spaceship*.  up until this point, this was all stuff i learned in high school and i'm a bit rusty.  but i genuinely don't know how to determine how long it took them to accelerate from the perspective on a stationary observer.

assuming constant acceleration, how would i calculate how long it took them to accelerate to top speed from the perspective of a stationary observer?

how would i get the equation for the acceleration of their ships over an hour so that i could determine the ship's velocity at any given time?",1

"emf graph of conducting rod moving through a constant magnetic field.hi, i have a question that i need clarification with.

&amp;#x200b;

let's say i have a conducting rod that is entering a magnetic field at some velocity v. i know that a positive charge in the rod moving through a magnetic field will experience a force. so the distribution of positive charges will shift to one side and the imbalanced charge distribution will induce an emf through the rod, having one end of the rod more negatively charged than the other at the end.

&amp;#x200b;

my question is this: as the rod moves into the magnetic field, there will be cutting of magnetic field lines. could i possibly use faraday's law to say that magnetic flux linkage increases, inducing an emf that will oppose the rod's movement into the magnetic field?

&amp;#x200b;

is a concept like magnetic flux linkage only used for closed loops and not rods? technically, while rods don't have a number of turns, it does have an area perpendicular to the magnetic field...

&amp;#x200b;

how would the emf graph induced look like? would it be very small as it enters the magnetic field due to faraday's law and then increase rapidly once the rod is completely inside the field as there no more change in magnetic flux? or am i getting some concepts wrong completely?

"water from the air concept – plausible?here’s an idea i had:

consider how a rocket stove works..

there is an inlet where wood is fed into the stove and an outlet for which the exhaust can vent. very simple but very effective.

now apply that idea toward a water collection device: 

instead of using fire and wood use a heating element or alternatively you could use a fresnel lense heating a metal surface with focused concentrated sunlight.

the hot air would rise out the outlet of the stove and i believe this would draw in air into the inlet of the stove. not sure whether a constriction at the top of the outlet would be ideal to create a pressurized release of heated air that may draw in even more air into the inlet or whether that would lessen the ability.

zeolite rocks could be placed into where the wood would normally be stacked such that the air would be drawn through the porous material. this would cause the water to bead up and accumulate. you could make a drip pan to divert the water off into a container at that point. 

so my question is:

with wood burning stoves and rocket stoves, there is a lot of air drawn into the stove and often in a lot of airflow (several cfm.) 

is this condition possible to recreate absent consumables? could just heating the air make this possible? i know that smoke and the various release of different hydrocarbons have more mass then air alone so that would create more of a draft. also when fire burns it consumes the oxygen in the air. 

the ideal condition is to have a high rate of airflow going through the device so that water in the air will accumulate in the zeolite and be harvested. with heating air alone in the above described arrangement (absent consumables) is this possible to create a high rate of airflow?",1

"simple circular motion exerciseso i'm pretty sure i know what to do, but the book tells me i'm wrong. it goes as follows: ""when you throw a marble on a circular track with a 80 cm (0.80 m) radius, the module of its centripetal acceleration is 2 m/s\^2. it takes 4 seconds for the marble to do one rotation. how many more rotations will it do before stopping?"" (roughly translated from french).

&amp;#x200b;

first, i found the initial speed of the marble with a = v\^2/r, so speed = sqrt(a\*r), so sqrt(2\*0,8), which is roughly 1,265. then, i found the speed after one rotation with 2\*pi\*r / period, so 2\*pi\*0.8/4, which is roughly 1.257 m/s.

&amp;#x200b;

with this, i found the acceleration between the two with final speed\^2 = initial speed\^2 + 2\*a\*x. replacing x with 2\*pi\*0.8 and the respective speeds with the ones found above, i got an acceleration of  around -0.0021. with the same equation but this time with 0 as final speed, 1,257 as initial speed and the acceleration i found, i got 380.46 meters, so divided by 2\*pi\*0.8 i get 75.69 rotations.

"need advice on e&amp;mokay so i've been trying to solve questions from purcell &amp; morin electrodynamics. but the problem is that i can't. 70% of the time i have to look at the solutions.

similar is the case with dj griffith when i tried to do it 5-6 months ago. every time i miss some little detail that is crucial for the solution. after spending some 15-20 minutes on a question i turn to the  back of the book and read the solution. it is so elegantly and beautifully solved, it makes me feel like a cheater at times. i have tried using the common tips on problem solving: 1. read the questions carefully, 2. identify what is given and being asked, 3.apply the first principle method, etc...

some might say that i am just not smart enough. but i don't think that's the case. around 4 years ago, i cracked the iit engineering exam(if you are an indian you know it's the toughest) by studying for only 6-7 months whereas most of the students can't even while studying for 2 years. i was able to solve e&amp;m questions at that time. calculus was not a problem either. i am sorry if it feels like i'm boasting. a lot of people might reply down that i am not smart enough for physics. i'm sorry, i am not going to give up just like that.

something is going wrong. either my understanding is wrong or my approach is wrong or something else. to be honest, similar has been the case when it comes to other topics like qm, etc. my intuition used to be smooth earlier, now it's just confused mess. i really have no idea where i'm going wrong. has anyone faced a similar problem?

please give your suggestions.

"question concerning a (hydrogen/oxygen) fuel cell/ electrolytic cell setup.hopefully quick question: if i connect a fuel cell to an electrolytic cell, placing the fuel cell above the electrolytic cell, and decide to convert some of the potential energy of the water into electricity as it flows down (back into the electrolytic cell) (with, say, a turbine(s) ), the later should scale with the height difference between the two, right?

i'm certain it's impossible to just ""build higher"" until achieving a net gain (as far as the in/output of electrical energy is concerned), but i don't know enough about the related processes to be able to tell why, and that's been bugging me. (honestly i'm not sure even sure if this is more of a chemistry question....)

specifically: can the setup theoretically be freely scaled in height, if no, why, and if yes, which of the processes lose(s) in efficiency/ unit mass to compensate for the increased yield of the turbine?

here come the questions:

- are they really the same thing? i seem to recall from the back of my mind that there was some issue with massless fields, but i cannot find where i read it, or any place where they discuss these things for that matter.

- does scheme dependence play a role in the story?

- in particular, take qed in 2+1d. all 1pi diagrams are finite, which would mean that the beta functions are zero “a la c-s”, but they definitely are not “a la w”. it confuses me.

"designing a game level around 4th dimension. are my ideas theoretically valid?hello, as the title says i'm designing a small map themed around the 4th dimension. there sure will be some scifi mixed in but i'd like to validate my ideas before i proceed to create something that defies the real world physics (or theoretical) completely.


so basically the idea is that humanity discovered this weird area in the universe where higher dimensional objects interrupt with our 3d universe (oddly enough it's only a local phenomena). people studied it and figured out how to ""stabilize"" these objects and built some kind of a 4th dimensional museum/entertainment park around it - that's the map i'm creating.


the way i think about it is with the 2d creature living in flatland analogy. you could crush it/obstruct its' world from your 3d world right? i wanna do kind of the same with the 4th dimension. there's also another part which says 4th dimension is time. i can crudely imagine both explanations separately but they don't quite come together for me. however i'd like to use them both.


the ideas:
i wanna have areas which are ""stabilized"" (safe for 3d creature to explore) and then unstable areas where objects would be popping in and out randomly and could kill you. 
	
* in safe areas, 4d objects could only be observed visually - have no collision or their collision would be locked in place in 3d
	
* tessaract - i wanted to throw the player inside a (hollow) hypercube but i'm unsure if that even makes sense. basically you would go inside all 6 (8?) of the cubes in tessaracts' 3d projection and then maybe teleport in another projection of it since that's about everything i could think of. is that reasonable?
	
* in unstable areas there would be randomly killing 4d objects or a moving timescale where things would go back and forth in time under your legs. xyz coordinates would stay the same for you, only the time axis would change so you would see objects in the room moving around in time. this would probably be only a visual thing, done by holograms and animations but theoretically if you move yourself on a timescale to a point where there's a collision in your xyz at the time, you die right?
	
* at the end you would get sucked into a black hole but i have yet to figure that part out

	
do these ideas make at least a little bit of sense or does it go against physics too much?
are there any other interesting 4d ideas i could throw in?

"data handling strategies in computational physicsfor the next month or so i will do some numerical analysis on a system. the last time i did anything numerics related was about 4 years ago during my undergraduate studies, where at some point i struggled with having so much data in various files and folders that i couldn't process everything. the biggest problem was that it was all not structured very well and occasionally i would overwrite previous files by accident, because i didn't choose the correct name. i did more or less what was taught to me during a computational physics course: write all parameters you use explicitly in the folder and file names, and each file is just a csv file with a number of columns in it.

i sometimes talk to colleagues and physics friends about this and the majority uses the same strategy: store all your data in hundreds or thousands of files. however, when i talk to my non-physics friends, those that handle data say they have one big data warehouse and then use something like sql to extract the data they need.

"physics revolving airplanesi have two questions. and this only regards newton’s 3 laws and the forces of lift(fn), thrust(fa), weight(fg), and drag(ff).

i) to takeoff, an airplane must accelerate until its forward speed gives it enough lift to get of the the ground. what are two ways in which the mass of the airplane affects takeoff?

my answer: the weight of the aircraft affects the lift and the drag of the aircraft. more weight means more thrust needed to accelerate and the force of lift would need to be greater than that of the weight in order for it to properly takeoff.

ii) why is friction greater at lower altitudes?

my answer: friction is greater at lower altitudes because the air is more dense than that of being at higher altitudes

 what im wondering is there a way to solve for the sunset over a mountain of known height and distance away? such as in my (shitty) ms paint drawing:  my question is, if you know the height of the mountain, and the height of the observer, and the distance between them, and the angle formed from the sunsets, is it possible to work out a solution to the radius of the earth?

i ask because currently in my lab class i am trying to measure the radius of the earth using sunrise and sunset, and both of those have mountains in the way that are seriously affecting our data.

assumptions you can make:

the distance between the observer and the mountain is essentially just d, and flat, that is to say you can assume that there is no curvature between them (if this helps). 

the mountain is in the range of 5-10 times the height of the observer,  so it doesn't form a near rectangle or anything.

2) what angle am i meant to measure? i presume this is why on one page is saying cos theta while the other sin but i’m not sure. i know  in rotating coils you measure the angle between the normal to the coil and the magnetic field lines. and as emf is max when flux linkage is zero, therefore emf is max when the coil is parallel to field lines therefore the angle the normal makes is 90 which points towards a sin relationship. is this what’s going on because i don’t really know what angle is what and what’s going on.

* the maximum acceleration that the craft experiences is 5.6 g.
* the dimensions of the fin are 1.22 (width) by 1.524 (length) by 0.22 (height) meters.
* the total mass of the rocket (falcon heavy centerstage) is 424.6 tonnes, however, the burned fuel changes this to around 30 tonnes.
* at this point, the aerodynamic pressure is of 2.6 kn/m\^2
* the mass of the fin is 100 kg (not totally sure).
* the diameter of the stage is 3.7 meters (this makes the total cross section cutting right through the fins 3.7+1.524\*2=6.748)

the device must be activated either while floating within the top 6 inches of water or while being held just above the surface of the water

you may only interact with your device once to activate it in the beginning. after that the device must operate on its own. 

the device may not damage the container. 

the device must be self contained. it may not alter the characteristics of the water in the container by dumping sand, chemicals, salt, etc. 

you may not use any live animals as part of your device (lol).

now, the earth is orbiting the sun, the sun is orbiting something else and that is orbiting etc.

now, if we would try to find the relatively slowest object in the universe and start orbiting that, then time would go much slower than on earth (for example).

this is the point where i don't understand why from there on, different models like fowkes or owens &amp; wendt exist, which devide the surface tension into components. the young-dupré equation combined with the rule of geometric already has only one unknown variable left: the solid's surface tension/free energy. so you would just have to measure the contact angle and the liquid's surface tension and could calculate the surface free energy.

 it has been suggested that a possible transportation system to connect two cities such as boston and washington, d.c., might function like this: drill a tunnel straight from boston to washington. a car released in boston would fall under the influence of gravity, gaining speed, and then finally coasting back to the surface at washington. the only expenditure of energy required would be that to overcome friction, and this could be reduced by using an evacuated tunnel or magnetic levitation of the train or other possible techniques. assuming the density of the earth is constant (it isn't), and using only the value of the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface (9.8 m/s2) and the radius of the earth (6380 km) determine how long it would take to travel between any two cities via a straight tunnel. the result, rather surprisingly, is about:

"energy changes in a dielectricdear all,

&amp;#x200b;

quick question about dielectrics. say you have charged up your capacitor, with a dielectric inside it, and then disconnected it from the power supply. so by q = vc, as the capacitance decreases but the charge stays the same, the voltage increases. so c decreases, v increases. then, looking at equations for energy, e = 1/2qv so if voltage increases then the energy increases, and likewise if e = 1/2q\^2/c, if c decreases then energy increases. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm asked to explain why the energy increases once the dielectric is removed. i would have gone straight to use of equations, however, the mark scheme writes:

&amp;#x200b;

energy increases because: in the polar dielectric molecules align in the field with positive charged end toward the negative plate

work is done on the capacitor separating the positively charged surface of the dielectric from the negatively charged plate (or vice versa).

&amp;#x200b;

i'm at a loss as to what they mean here. any ideas?

i understand that inserting a dielectric when the power supply is off will increase the capacitance but charge stays the same, so by e = 1/2q\^2/c, the energy decreases, so the opposite should happen if you remove the dielectric. however, i can't understand why they are talking about the polar molecules of the dielectric. when the dielectric is in the material, the positive poles are attracted to the negative plate, which attracts more electrons to that negative plate. where does energy come in in the explanation given in the mark scheme?",1

# tldr

trying to use water to store some heat during afternoon and release it at night (or more functionally store cold at night and release it during afternoon).

# background/reason

i feel like i am overlooking something major. the thermostat is custom code on an omega 2+ which logs multiple temps including outside from the open weather map api. code is not a simple is temp above/below value =&gt; turn on/off-it looks at stuff like has the ac been running long enough that cooling limit has been reached for this cycle.

being south texas and an older house and upstairs, the hot afternoon has been a struggle even with upstairs having a separate ac unit. to help combat this, precooling happens from like 5am to 10am, but this means it gets up to 3.25 degrees colder during that part just to not be 80+ inside mid afternoon.

i had read an article one time about a company that was making ac systems affordable enough for use in houses that freeze a block of ice at night and use it to cool the house during the heat/peak hours (can't find that article again). one day i thought why not make a hybrid form where it is thermal mass in the air return to (more or less) ""release heat at night and absorb it during the day"" which would help the ac unit.

&amp;#x200b;

# setup

been trying to figure out a way to use thermal mass to help in some way, but didn't want to lug a bunch of cinder blocks upstairs. realized water and copper pipe is my answer. this is still early phase testing/prototyping, which is why it is just 20 feet coiled 1/2 inch copper and no fins, 12 gallon cooler, holes in lid not sealed, and why the coil is not centered (first iteration it was mounted to cooler lid, but that made things difficult to work with). pump is a 300 gph pump. started with 5 gallons of distilled water.

[ early results

this is the last week of data. installing it didn't change behavior, but turning the pump on did stabilize the temp, kinda since it seemed to just not let it get as cool while the upper limit didn't really change. then tried some experiments where added frozen gallons jugs of water which quickly cooled the water down but didn't seem to affect the air. at some point in there i reduced the water to just under 3 gallons (just before the pump started pulling in bubbles), but again no change.

[ is the past day for a better look (with low/high cutoff hidden since the temp is high enough to not interact with them right now). the pump was off the whole time except for the short bit where the water temp went up. this time i had the flow rate of the pump as low as it would go, which was still a large flow of water and a long/high enough length of tube/pipe/resistance that i had to start the flow with it at a higher rate then turn it down.

[ hour data range for a closer look at when the pump was turned on. data points are 1 minute intervals in all the graphs.

[ \~2/3 of this overlap with the previous image, but better screenshot and the following \~40 minutes

[ expectations/help

my expectations going in to this was that in this configuration it would have a small impact, but be a proof of concept so v2 can do more. figured when the air is cooling down it would be a little slower to cool, but when it was warming up it would resist warming up some too as the copper/water absorb/release heat. water flow rate could be used to adjust the impact it had a little bit (or thermostat controls times when pump is on/off).

i'm running out of ideas as to what the problem could be. the only other thing i can think of is if it doesn't have enough water. but a possible error that i am going to test tonight and add the results of is if the pump itself is heating the water up, to test will disconnect the tube from pump and turn it on to see if it makes the same heating curve in water temperature.

during my senior year i had an idea for an experiment that had to do with the potential of saving a considerable amount of energy in the ignition of a fusion reaction (tokomak confined) and presented it to two of my professors who assured me that the math is correct and told me that indeed the idea had promise and that i should pursue it for my masters-phd. as mentioned, getting that far is not an option for me (mainly due to finances) and i was wondering if there would be a way to pursue the experiment otherwise.

having sent to a couple of research centers where i live, i had my idea turned down without said centers reading the written experiment proposal, as i lack the level of degree to make a proper application - which is understandable. i really don't know how i should move forward with this, or if there is anything i can do about it, but i do indeed feel it is a waste.

how big a difference does the existence (or positioning) of a single human body make on the motion of planets in our solar system, millions of years in the future? i know we can't predict what the difference will be, but do we have reason to think that there likely \*will\* be a non-negligible difference?

&amp;#x200b;

why might there be a non-negligible difference? well, figuring out the motion of the planets in our solar system is an n-body problem. so that motion is supposed to be chaotic - highly sensitive to changes in initial conditions. at least, on a timescale of [5 million years]( the positions of planets should be highly sensitive to conditions now. but just how sensitive is an n-body system to \*tiny\* perturbations in the gravitational field? 

&amp;#x200b;

a single human body exerts some small amount gravitational force on nearby planets. so, if i add a single human to earth's population now, or i move them from one position to another, how much would that change the motion of planets in the future? and over what timescale?

&amp;#x200b;

bonus questions:

*  would the differences continue to grow over time, or would they eventually diminish to nothing? (i figure that in a sufficiently chaotic system they'd just keep growing, but would be interested to hear otherwise.)
*  would the effects be similar on the scale of a galaxy, or beyond?",1

"expansion of the universe and the hubble constant.i was introduced to some cosmology concepts today and it left me with some questions. 
1. the first is to do with the expansion of space. how is that the rate at which the universe expands is relative to the observer? for example, if i am 2 lightyears from a galaxy, space is expanding between me and the galaxy. that much is clear. but if someone is only one light year away from that same galaxy why would that galaxy not be moving away at the same rate? typing this i just realized that it may because if your closer, then there is less space expanding between the two points, is this why?
2. my second question comes from the hubble constant. we were taught that the age of the universe can be derived by the reciprocal of the hubble constant. but this made no sense to me because as time passes, the age of the universe increases, so how would the hubble constant accurately predict the universes age? is this hubble constant changing as time goes on?",1

there is no difference between visible wavelenghts and others (&gt; or &lt;) but only the ones in the visible spectrum can be picked up by our eyes - is this right so far?

"lever momentum question photo illustrates question. 


example a and b are the same lever.

a lever with side l (3m long) has 10 n while side x(1m long) has 25 n of force. to balance the lever side l need only 8.33 n. so there is a surplus on side l of 1.67 n

question: on point b when lever on side x is at a 45 degree angle then comes down on side l with 1.67 n of force until it becomes level to the ground( lever becomes parallel to the ground)
if the 10n on side l as it's coming down becomes level to the ground, at the point where the lever is parallel to ground and the 10n is suddenly removed as the downward momentum is in play, 

will the downward momentum have enough kinetic energy to keep lifting side x with the 25n once 10n is removed on side l?

or regardless of the downward momentum,  once the 10n is removed will side x instantly begin to move down? 

i hope this is clear but it is kind of complicated for me to explain. i'm thinking once the moment of side l comes down from a distance,  once the 10n are instantly removed when it becomes parallel to the ground it will still have enough momentum to keep lifting the 25n for a foot or so before side x with 25n comes crashing down.

"data/signal processing: which method to use to find the frequency?for a reaserch project, we had to study swimming particles.  depending on the initial conditions and varying parameters, we observed a huge difference in the behaviour of those swimmers. now, the goal is to quantify our observations.

&amp;#x200b;

the particles (w=0.5 mm, l=1 mm) are spinning with an angular velocity that we increment by changing our settings and depending on the spin of each particle, the group swims at a different speed. 

we recorded everything on the lab camera and processed each video resulting in a huge amount of data such as coordinates and angle with the x axis of each particle. 

&amp;#x200b;

when trying to analyse the angular velocity, we encountered a few problems. 

one of them (comes from the image processing) was that the range of the angle is \[0,180\]. at a very low frequency, the particles align with the x axis, in such a way that a small perturbation results in an angle rapidly switching between a huge value (\~180°) and a very small value (\~0°). we were able to overcome this problem by considering the sinus of the angle. 

the result is a sinusiodal signal whose frequency should give us the angular velocity right? 

&amp;#x200b;

my main question is the following:

**how can i get that frequency from a list of numbers?** 

i tried to use the fft function (working with numpy) but it doesn't seem to work well, perhaps because of the noise. it seems like there are too much methods to smooth the signal and i don't really have the time to go through precise documentation to pick the right one.

"voltage drop, ac, and dcone of the reasons we use ac to transmit power is because it looses less power over longer distances. but the way i understand it, ac should actually loose more power than dc.  here is why. 

intuitively i can imagine electrons in a wire like a long string of balls connected by springs, to simulate there repulsive forces, i believe in thermodynamics something similar is done. 

power is lost because when you push on one end x distance, since the force has to travel across so many springs friction causes some of that force to be absorbed in the compression so that the ball at the end will move &lt;x.  so if you vibrate the first ball in the chain, if the wire is long enough the ball at the end may not even move at all,  in this way i imagine ac current will diminish in a very long wire. 

&amp;#x200b;

but for dc current, when you compress the first ball and continue to push, once the chain reaches its max compression the current would then flow without relativity any more loss, in other words you only have the initial loss of power to get every movement, the opposite would be pulling a loose chain until it is taut, all the pulling until it is taut is doing no work but then the chain is good, as opposed to pulling the chain then pushing it back before it reaches taut, which would be the ac analog. 

&amp;#x200b;

so what is wrong with my model? it seems intuitively dc would be a better choice for more efficient travel across long distance.",1

"this table is made of particles...which are excitations in fieldshello learned physicists.  i have a relatively simple question about matter to which i hope a simple answer is possible. 

i understand a small bit about particle physics and field theory in that i read pop science books and articles and find it all fascinating to think about (without ever really grasping the mathematics behind it all).  nowadays it seems to me that matter is best described as quantum excitations in fields, so higgs, electromagnetic etc. 

i am sitting at a table here, and the table is made of wood, which is made of different molecules, which themselves are made of different atoms comprising of electrons, protons (made of quarks) and neutrons (also formed of quarks) which are all quantum excitations in their fields.  you could say they are particles outstanding in their fields? little joke there

so these particles, i presume, don’t actually sustain over the lifetime of the table, or even from moment to moment? if i could somehow identify the particles (which i think is impossible due to the uncertainty principle) would we see that the particles are constantly changing, flashing in and out of existence, but their fields remain, which is what gives the perception of concreteness?  and as the years pass, and the elements break down the table, attrition of particles in the air, rain, whatever else, constantly coming up against those of the table see the table being broken down and dissolved.  is that correct?

what i’m asking, i suppose, is that from moment to moment, are the particles which make up something solid, actually in flux constantly and at an imperceptible fast speed, or are the particles sort of there, frozen, and remain there until its broken down and changed into something else

or maybe i’m totally off

"a question about quantum mechanics.what does quantum mechanics mean when it says that, for example, the position of an electron is not determined, it’s probabilistic. is it saying that that’s the very nature of things or is it saying that that’s as far as we can go to determining the position of the electron. in other words, is it a matter that we, as humans, din’t have the technology to determinate an exact position of an electron, or is it that it’s the very nature of an electron to not have a determined trajectory. do we not know what determines the electron trajectory or is the trajectory really random?

"does the rise of electric charge the u(1) symmtry group and the ""complexity"" of the field entail special properties of the em interaction and charge?okay, so when we impose phase invariance ( u(1) ) on a field we get through noether's theorem the conservation of electric charge and consequently em. but we only get a charge if the field we're dealing with is complex(?), if we try to apply it to (for example) a real scalar field we get no charge. now i interpreted this (and my prof) as the real field doesn't interact through em, which is fine, but the question i always had was, what is the relation between the ""complexity"" of the field and charge? 

to answer this question, i went through the following reasoning; now let's forget about ""complexity"" as it's in essence just a neat mathematical trick to deal with 2-element vectors ( or is it ?? ) so we represent out complex field as a (real) vector field with 2-elements.

and now i cut the question intro smaller questions: 

+ if this is just a mathematical edifice, can we reformulate the mathematical framework so that the 2-element vector field becomes a real scalar field and keep the electric charge property ( u(1) will change as well)? 

+ do we lose the charge information by doing this? 

+ if not then what else do we lose?

+ if yes, then what is so special about electric charge that we need the extra ""degree of freedom""? 

+ and consequently what does this tell us about the em interaction and it's need for that ""degree of freedom""?

and what does this reasoning say about the other interactions and their unitary groups? (i'm not advanced enough)",1

"a question on simulating quantum computing and its relation to real world simulations.i am having difficulty describing what i want to say when it comes to quantum computing, so please bare with me if i make mistakes in my phrasing.

from everything that i have read on quantum computing and how it works, it seems that the inherent advantage of using quantum computing is that we get ""free"" computation in the form of probabilities when we read various states of the qbits and their relations to other qbits.  that is to say it is easier to do quantum computation then it is to do simulated quantum computation.  so while there are websites out there where you can do simulated quantum computation all the way up to 22 qbits, its seems that it would be impossible to do simulated quantum computation on lets say 256 qbits.   where as it seems we would be able to do quantum computation with 256 qbits if we get the machinery in place, etc....   with that in mind, it seems impossible to perform a 100% accurate simulation of any part of a universe where you have to deal with even only 256 qbits.  am i wrong in my assumption?  like, how can we even come close to performing an accurate simulation of even the simplest molecular interactions if we are unable to simulate all of the underlying processes, such as quantum interactions, etc....",1

"[error propagation] error bars and dividing quantities without uncertaintiesnot specifically a physics question but rather one that is related to all sciences.

attempt: time taken for 10 oscillations is 8.4 ± 0.21s, so time taken for 1 oscillation is 0.84 ± 0.21, as the dividing quantity does not have an uncertainty, how ever the answer says it is **0.84 ± 0.03 s, accept uncertainty 0.03 or 0.025**. 

my two issues with this answer.

1. apparently they divided the uncertainty by 10 as well, i thought if you were dividing a quantity without an uncertainty you do not need to touch the uncertainty

"could inertia also be connected to extra dimensions?so i have absolutely no training in physics but i do love the subject.  i love critically thinking about physics and the nature of reality. 
(unfortunately table top physics isnt a thing anymore)

but i had a intriguing question and never had a professional to ask.

i wonder if inertia could be connected to extra dimensions and the motion of energy and mass (because e=mc2) through those extra dimensions. 
i was thinking about this because i know that space and time are sometimes considered to be a interwoven fabric of reality, but that you can effect one or the other by changing your acceleration. 

i am wondering if inertia could be thought of the same way as time and space.  
can the resistence of mass be due to it already having a nonzero motion through unseen spaces? and when we apply a motion through space and time it subtracts from the nonzero motion through another dimensional space? giving us the resistance we observe?",1

"what are the effects of assumptions and interpretation on understanding quantum mechanics?i often wonder how much of the strangeness of quantum mechanics results from the underlying assumptions in developing quantum mechanics as well as how the results of quantum mechanics are interpreted.  

for example, how does quantum mechanics treat particles and space, and what sort of assumptions do we have to make in order to formalize our treatment of particles and space?  does interpretation of something like the uncertainly principal require impose additional assumptions?

most articles and books written for the lay person proceed as if particles are 0-dimensional points, space is built up as a continuous division of points, and the uncertainty principal imposes limits on what we can know through measurement.  in doing so, we are assuming space is a continuous object, there are particles in space that occupy a single point, and once measured, a particle has a well defined location even if we cannot entirely know that location.  

however, i think that if one changes the background assumptions, the understanding of what happens above changes.  (i don't think these are great examples nor do i believe them - they're just easy to think about and thus a useful starting point.)  if we still assume space is continuous but particles had some size and shape which is able to move in a non-uniform manner (different parts moving in different speeds or directions), our inability to measure its position could be related to how we try and collapse this into a single positional value.  or, what if particles are just bigger than what we would expect and in doing a measurement, we are only seeing a given piece a particle?",1

"white light in: single slit, young's double slit and diffraction gratingi'm just wondering how best to understand how white light behaves in single slit, double slit and a diffraction grating experiments.

&amp;#x200b;

this is apparently the image for young's double slit: [ know that by w = lambda\*d/s, as red light has a larger wavelength the fringe spacing will be greater, meaning the fringes themselves are wider. if you look at the central fringe, where all wavelengths have interfered constructively, why is it tinged with a kind of murky red? is this because the red fringe is larger? if so, then, it is clear that the next colour (moving outwards from the centre) is blue, then white, then red. i'm confused how this works with regard to the wavelengths...

&amp;#x200b;

for a diffraction grating, again i understand that directly opposite the beam (source of light), there is constructive interference so you get a thin white line. however, you get spectra of all the colours after dark gaps. in these dark gaps, is all the light arriving out of phase with each other? if so, how do you get the dominant colours forming the spectrum in between the dark gaps?",1
"rotating an object by applying forcehello,

i have a question about how to use ""thrusters"" to rotate a landing module. for simplicity, it is all in 2d, the red arrows are the direction of the thrusters when they fire and it is upright, yellow is the rotation axis.

i have an inital rotation of the ship thetha, and i want to figure out how much thrust i have to apply on what thruster to rotate it back so the rotation of it is correct again (aka. no rotation). all thrusters always fire orthogonal to the surface they are mounted to.

what i know is (i) the mass of the object, (ii) distance from the thrusters to the axis, and (iii) how much force each thruster can apply in newtons.

&amp;#x200b;

i wonder how i can go from those pieces of information to a change in angular velocity? or in other words, how i know how many degrees/radians i have turned if i have fired a thruster for *n* seconds with a force of *f* newtons.

&amp;#x200b;

to solve this problem, i have looked at the formula for torque which seems to be ""t=f\*r\*sin(theta)"". f is the force, r the distance from the axis, and theta is the angle at which the force is applied. in my example, if i would move up the thrusters slightly, this should always be pi/2 because the thrust vector is orthogonal to the surface, so i can simplify to ""t=f\*r"". if i say that i apply 300n and the thruster is 2m away, i apply 600\[nm\] of force but know i am stuck, and i have no idea how to calculate the change in angle if i apply this force for n seconds.

"expanding on the rubber sheet analogyhello. not long ago i took part in a discussion about general relativity and the well-known rubber sheet analogy, and it made me realize there was a gap in my understanding of it. i went looking for answers and i believe i managed to fill the gap, but i'd like to hear a confirmation that my current understanding is on the right track.

the rubber sheet is a great tool to understand how gravity can affect photons even though they don't have any mass - while they are always moving in a straight line, this straight line can appear curved without taking the effect of gravity into account. it *seems* to explain attraction of two bodies (a marble will fall into the ""well"" created by the more massive object on the rubber sheet), but that explanation itself requires gravity to work, so that's not really helpful.

this is the gap i was talking about. i understood that mass warps space around it, causing straight lines in its vicinity to appear curved. in addition it causes objects with mass to attract one another. i realized i view these two effects as separate and my original understanding couldn't explain how both of those effects could be explained by a single cause.

looking for answers, i realized that the rubber sheet analogy fails mainly because it only shows us the effect of gravity on space rather than spacetime. so what i did was to imagine a model that takes time into account. normally the two dimensional sheet represents our three spacial dimensions, but to be able to fit in time as well, we'll have to further reduce our three dimensional space to just a line, with the other dimension of the sheet representing time.

an object staying in place would keep its spacial coordinate the same while the temporal coordinate would steadily increase as the time passes, effectively moving in a straight line. however, if there's another massive object, the sheet gets warped same as in the original analogy and the straight line representing the object ""staying in the same place"" gets curved towards the massive object, which in effect translates into the attraction.

so what gravity does is that it curves the ""future"" of nearby objects towards its centre, meaning they will be closer in the future, which means that they accelerate towards it.

is this somewhat correct? can this model more faithfully represent how gravity works? are there any obvious problems or shortcomings?",1

"this is out of curiosityok so a few days ago i was climbing a big rope(you know the 30-40 cm diameter ones that you put on the roof and climb them during pe? yeah that one) without anything to keep me safe(i knew it was a stupid idea but i just went with it anyway) and i managed to tear my skin on two places while falling back down - one a bit worse than the other and i also felt quite a beat of heat afterwards. so i got curious. how much force was exerted onto my hands and why didn't my entire hand get its skin ripped apart and instead only on two places i got hurt. i asked my physics teacher to help me out but sadly she is always really busy with projects and other stuff so she just took a quick glance at this and told me that it's going to be a very tedious thing to calculate. after a bit of counting, i could count about 40 points on my hands where they touch the rope and when i told her about it she said the easiest way to calculate this would be to assume that all of them are the same size and are under the same amount of force. 

&amp;#x200b;

obviously, no exact calculations can be made unless there is a 3d scan of how i hold the rope so for simplicity's sake let's assume that i held the rope with both of my hands at about 40 points of contact. let's also say that each point of contact is a circle with a diameter of 1 cm. considering clothes and boots let's say i weigh about 90 kilograms. the skin on my hands is a bit thicker than a normal person's because in my spare time i go climbing. i am about 190 cms tall and i made  6 steps up from about my waistline to standing upright so let's assume i fell about 4 meters. the fall itself wasn't all that fast i would say about 1m/s but my hands felt quite hot after it. if i were to guess they were probably about 30-40 degrees celsius and took like 2-3 minutes to cool off. the rope itself wasn't all that rough. can't say i have used a lot of ropes in my life but let's assume it's a standard roughness one. and i think that's everything needed to set things in motion.

&amp;#x200b;

up until now, i have been playing around with simple forces. like two cubes attached together with a string that can be neither compressed nor moved(so basically a pillar with no weight) being pulled or pushed at different angles and having to solve the force that is applied to them, so i have no idea what to do with the 40 points of contact that are on an imperfect object like a hand. i don't even know if they matter or not like for me it sounds logical that you can't just lump them in as one thing that has a force applied on it but for all i know my intuition might be wrong. so any ways i can pull this off with the minimal amount of effort and the highest possible amount of accuracy?

vf = sqrt(1083.1 m2 /s2 )

the way i did it was to take the angle between the vector **r** and **dl**, as t = π/2 - θ , so the angle between the vector **r** and **d** becomes θ, hence by the definition of an angle in radians dl=r\*dθ. where r=d\*sec(θ), which gives me dl=d\*sec(θ)dθ . however my answer came out to be wrong.

"does vacuum energy and the expansion of space violate the conservation of energy?space is expanding but the density of vacuum energy of space is essentially constant. this means that the amount of energy in the universe is increasing, violating the conservation of energy.

according to [this]( scientific american article:
&gt; it turns out that in einstein’s theory of general relativity, regions of space with positive energy actually push space outward. as space expands, it releases stored up gravitational potential energy, which converts into the intrinsic energy that fills the newly created volume. so even the expansion of the universe is controlled by the law of energy conservation.

is that something most physicists agree upon? wouldn't this mean the universe will stop expanding at some point, or is there an infinite amount of ""gravitational potential energy"" preexisting in the universe? if the latter is the case, that seems to also break the conservation of energy.

"[general relativity] black holes, outside observers, holographic principle and entropynot my specialty, but i always wondered if these ideas are connected or if it's just my mind stretching it.

it is my current understanding that for an observer far from a non-rotating black hole, they never really see matter fall into the event horizon. it just asymptotically approaches the event horizon as its light gets redshifted.

if that's accurate, then i imagine the result for an outside observer is that all matter that's falling into the blackhole should  be seen as an ever-falling red-shifting very thin spherical shell.

q1: how would any observer ever see a black hole increase in size if nothing ever crosses the event horizon?

q2: wouldn't this asymptotic behavior lead to black holes being perceived as an ever red-shifting spherical shell?

the holographic principle and the black hole entropy are related to the surface area of a black hole's event horizon. since all information that fell into the blackhole is seen as asymptotically approaching its boundary, then all the information whose future is in the interior volume of the event horizon should be compressed in a thin spherical shell on the event horizon.

q3: can this be seen as a valid intuition for why the black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon, and its relation to the holographic principle?

basically, is it all just a property of how outside observers perceive the asymptotic trajectories of infalling particles?",1

"[subtle question that starts obvious]: changes in electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, right?i'm about 99.999...% sure that the answer to the above question is ""yes.""

so now... the subtler question.

when typical high school/intro undergrad books will say that light slows down in a medium that is not a vacuum. but after reading a bit of feynman, i'm not sure that is entirely correct:  i'm understanding this chapter correctly, let us set up a situation where we have a light source on the left, a magical field detector on the right; vacuum everywhere, except a sheet of glass in between the two. then, the source is switched on.

if the glass sheet is not present, then the detector will read oscillating e and b fields corresponding to the frequency of the light being emitted. the time it will take for the detector to sense these changes is how long it takes light to propagate through the vacuum space. so far, so good, i think.

now, the sheet of glass is positioned between the source and detector, and then the source is turned on. will there be a difference in the time it takes for the detector to start showing the oscillating e and b fields?

if i understand feynman's text correctly, the answer is ""no""; in the medium of the glass, the phase velocity of light in the glass has slowed, because the oscillating e field induces an opposing e field in the glass by forcing the charge in the glass to line up/polarize. but the group velocity of light has not changed; throughout all of space, changes in the field continue to propagate at c. so, say, if with no sheet, it took 1 second for the detector to get a reading with no glass present then it should also take the same time--1 second-- for the detector to get a reading  when the glass is present. but, because the distinction between group and phse velocity is a fairly advanced concept, high school students are not exposed to this concept, nor are undergrads until they get to sophomore/junior/senior year, and instead the concept of ""phase velocity slows down"" is shorthanded to ""light slows down in a medium.""

is this the correct understanding of feynman's text, as well as a correct interpretation of current understanding about light? or am i getting something wrong?

"contradictory statements on the relationship between the electric field strength and capacitance.so in my quest to better understand capacitors i came across a bump.

if you look over at the[ dielectric section of the physics hypertextbook]( it says 
&gt; introducing a dielectric into a capacitor decreases the electric field, which decreases the voltage, which increases the capacitance.


so capacitance (the ratio of charge to voltage) is inversely proportional to the electric field strength right? 

but if you look over [at this website]( it says:
&gt; capacitance is directly proportional to the electrostatic force field between the plates. this field is stronger when the plates are closer together. therefore, as the distance between the plates decreases, capacitance increases.

......the complete opposite to what the hypertextbook says.

so, what gives?",1

"a black hole universe 

hi all

probably a silly question, but i was thinking about this last night and can't get it out of my head. hopefully someone can explain this to me.

imagine you have a universe that is big and has some (non-trivial) average density of matter. from a point at the edge of this universe, the gravitational effect could be calculated based on an assumption that all of the matter was located at a single point (i.e. the centre of mass of the universe) \[correct me if i am wrong on this\].

so i was thinking that if you made the universe bigger, but kept the average density of matter the same, the amount of matter (proportional to volume) would go up by the cube of the increase in radius, but the amount of gravity at the edge of the universe would increase as you only need to divide by r squared.

firstly, is the above correct, or am i making a mistake somewhere?

if the above is correct, then it would imply that if you grow the universe (but keep the average density the same, i.e. add uniform shells of matter at the outer edge), then at some point the edge of the universe will have enough gravity to effectively make it an event horizon. so the universe will become a black hole.

the problem i have with this is that shell theorem would say that each shell added should have no gravitational effect on the objects inside it. so to anything inside the universe there is no impact of the universe changing into a black hole. that seems really weird. it also seems to imply that for a given density, there is a maximum allowable size for a universe; is this right?

but i don't understand why. i recently read the fabric of the cosmos by brian greene and he uses an example of a train moving at relativistic speed. positioned on the train is a device which emits a flash of light. at an equal distance from the device, at opposite ends of the train carriage, are two individuals each armed with a gun. at the instant they see the flash of light they each fire their gun at the opposite individual.

&amp;#x200b;

from on board the moving train, both individuals see the flash of light at the exact same instant (because it has travelled the same distance in opposite directions) so both fire their guns at the exact same time. which means they're both dead.

&amp;#x200b;

but for an observer positioned on the ground, watching the train shoot past at relativistic speed, the individual facing the direction of travel sees the flash of light first, because he's moving into the beam of light. brian greene uses this example to illustrate that different observers will disagree on the simultaneity of events. but surely that means he will fire his gun first (because he sees the flash first) which means he kills the individual opposite before they have a chance to fire their gun. which results in a totally different outcome, not just a difference of perspective.

"question about moment of inertia (parallel axis theorem)the exercise i'm gonna do, asks the following:

&amp;#x200b;

what is the moment of inertia of h2o for rotation around an axis, through the center of mass and parallel to the z-axis? repeat for the two axes parallel to x and y and through the center of mass. the three orthogonal axes are called principal axes.

(sorry for bad english, the question was originally in danish). 

&amp;#x200b;

i calculated the moment of inertia for the water molecule, when oxygen is in origo, in another exercise. i also found the center of mass, which is (6.6\*10\^-12    ,   0).  

for this exercise, i answered that we should use the parallel axis theorem, and i found icm = ip-md\^2. as far as i understand, this is the moment of inertia parallel to the z- axis? i calculated it, and found the moment of inerta to be 2.94\*10\^-47 kg\*m\^2.

what i don't understand, is how i'm supposed to find the moment of inerta parallel to x and y. our book only tells how to find the moment of inertia parallel to z, as far as i can tell. i'm not a physics major, so i'm not used to thinking as a physicist would. am i supposed to use the same formula (icm = ip-md\^2)?

"simple physics question? (projectile acceleration/velocity)**an object is launched at a 45 degree angle from ground level and lands 240m away due to gravity; ignoring wind resistance, what is the initial velocity of the object?** what would be the simplest way of answering this? 

my main thought would be to find a calculation between how long it takes for the object's vertical velocity to go up and back down to the ground vs. the time it takes for the object to reach 240m. if t equals time of flight, vl equals the horizontal velocity at time 0, and vh equals the vertical velocity at time 0, then does:

* t = 240m/vl
* t = 2 \* ( vh/9.8m/s^(2) )

the first equation is pretty self explanatory, while the second comes from the time it takes for the object's vertical velocity to decelerate to 0 m/s due to gravity (presumably vh/9.8 m/s^(2)?) which would, since it is launched from ground level, be the same time it takes for it to accelerate back to the ground.

because the object is launched at a 45 degree angle, you can say that vh and vl are equal, and so vl = vh = vs therefore the true (45 degree) velocity of the object equals vs \* sqrt(2). so by setting the two equals equal to each other you get 240m/vs = 2 ( vs/9.8m/s^(2) ) which gives vs = 34.29m/s and gives the true velocity as 48.49m/s.

b) assume a larger mass is pulling  a globe to itself (and vice versa) and assume that this large object cannot be tormented. why doesn't the globe collapse in order to be closer to the center of gravity? or why doesn't it simply get denser? and if it does, would it also get colder as it's molecules are now having a harder time to move around?
c) assume a large mass that is pulling a body of liquid and vice versa. as the liquid hits the surface, if the force is strong enough, would it turn into a solid, as it's molecules would try to be closer to the center of gravity; or does this connect to some other complicated system?

"how does time dilation work?i thought i understood time dilation in special relativity, but then upon thinking about one of the most commonly cited examples (space travel), i realised i don’t really get what it means, in terms of who experiences what. 

let’s have a simple example. i have an astronaut who is going to board a ship heading to alpha centauri, 4.367 light years away. the ship, handwaving engine requirements, travels at 0.8c (~2.4 x 10^8 m/s). now, ignoring relativistic effects, if you travel 4.367 light years (4.13 x 10^16 metres) at 0.8 c, it should take about 5.46 years. i assume that means 5.46 years would pass *on earth* as the ship was in transit. calculating the time dilation effect gives a time of 9.09 years, presumably the time that passes for the astronaut..but that result, as in the maths from sr, seems to contradict what i’ve been told in words about sr. like, from what i’ve read, time travels slower for faster objects. how then, can the timespan be *longer* on the ship than on earth, since a lower rate of time flow should lead to less time elapsing than on earth? and i’ve read stuff about astronauts theoretically going very fast on a round trip that for them was merely days or weeks, but would be thousands of years on earth, which again implies the timespan elapsed on the ship should be shorter..so where have i messed up? have i gotten confused about which t value is which in the time dilation equation, or is it something else? this is actually part of my a level course, so although this is partially out of curiousity, it’s also partially a schoolwork question.",1

so i thought i had solved this problem but i haven't been able to recreate my solution i came up with a few days ago. generally i think i keep messing up my algebra but maybe i'm attacking the problem incorrectly.

so energy initial equals energy final due to conservation of energy

ei = 1/2m(velocity 1)^2 (kinetic energy only)

ef = 1/2m(velocity 2)^2 + mgh (kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy)

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(velocity final)^2 + mgh

velocity final is actually (1/3 velocity initial) so

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(1/3velocity initial)^2 + mgh

mass cancels out entirely, and now velocity initial can just be referred to as ""v""

1/2v^2 = (1/2)(1/3v)^2 + gh

**what i've tried:**

(1) if the cg (center of gravity) of the chair is directly above the pivot p, then the chair will balance on its own, with or without the wall. the wall merely serves as a decorative purpose in this case and no force (including n and f) is applied onto the chair.

(2) using the same example as (1), i do not see the need for the ground to provide friction as there is no n by the wall on the chair.

(3) the example in (1) is an example of the statement. therefore i assume the wall and the ground to be rough, and the cg to be out of pq.

before i proceeded, i remember being taught that if the cg of an object (with no walls and only the ground) is above the pivot point, the object will topple over, due to the net moment produced by the weight when taking moments at the pivot point. 

however, in the problem, if the friction of the wall acts upwards, then it could balance the weight. since there is friction by the wall, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the wall. since there is a horizontal force (due to the normal force by the wall), the only force that could counteract it is the friction by the ground to the left. since there is friction by the ground, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the ground.",1

"renormalisation group flow evolutionit's my understanding that with the renormalisation flow equation you start at the uv cut off at which the average effective action describes the classical action at large energy scales, and as it flows it goes towards an ir scale. as it does this it is integrating out quantum fluctuations and when k=0 it is equal to the quantum effective action. however, the ir scale is large scale, so how is this described by the quantum effective action. to me it seems like it would make more sense to have classical action at the ir and quantum at the uv. i'm trying to understand how the rg flow allows us to see how the theory evolves at microscopic and macroscopic scales but the process of 'integrating out' fluctuations is confusing me, does this mean including them, or taking them out of the effective action?",1

"predeterminism and timeso, hear me out. 

if a light source travels 500 million years to reach us. does that mean from the perspective of the light source when it is creating events or whatever it is doing, everything is in real time, but to us, it is delayed by 500 million years.
if so, then why is it not talked about that we can essentially see the future for the origin of the light source from the future although it doesn't realise what is about to happen (if it had consciousness) from its origin point perspective.

i've been trying to wrap my head around the photoelectric effect but i'm kind of stuck with something in planck's equation. the snippet below is from an article about photoelectric effect i'm currently reading

&gt;according to planck's equation, the energy of a photon is proportional to the light frequency, *ν*:  
&gt;  
&gt;e = h*ν*

&gt;the light frequency *v* is inversely proportional to wavelength λ:  
&gt;  
&gt;c = λ*ν*

can someone explain to me why **the light frequency** ***ν*** **is inversely proportional to wavelength λ** ?

at first i thought the energy of a photon is constant but that's obviously wrong from my understanding. is it simply ""because it just is""?

"does the buoyant force on everyday objects due to the atmosphere affect the kinematics of said objects?so i started learning fluid mechanics; and after learning that the atmosphere is considered a fluid that has the potential to create a buoyant force on any object located in the atmosphere, i am wondering if this buoyant force would need to be taken into consideration for any precise calculations.

i calculated the buoyant force on a human at sealevel by the following means:

\[; f\_b = f\_t - f\_b ;\]

\[; f\_b = p\_t a - p\_b a ;\]

\[; f\_b = a (p\_t - p\_b) ;\]

\[; f\_b = a \\rho g h ;\]

then estimating (for a human): \[; h = 1.75 m;\], \[; m = 68 kg ;\], \[; \\rho = \\frac{1.2 kg}{m\^3} ;\] (this is the density of air at sea level), \[; a= \\pi (0.1524)\^2 m\^2 ;\]

\[; f\_b = 1.5 n ;\]

so this would mean that a scale would read to weigh 1.5 n less than you actually weigh. but my question is ""if your feet will press against the ground, inhibiting air from going in between the two. will this decrease the pressure on the bottom giving you an even higher buoyant force?"". also, ""for very large objects (with large areas), would the buoyant force need to be considered in order to correctly describe the physics of the object?""",1

now i understand the difference between a galvanic and an electrolytic cell, and that in theory pushing electrons and energy the ""wrong way"" through the battery will result in the non spontaneous reaction occurring. but that isn't what is happening here. somehow the current is entering the anode, where it would then proceed to reduce the anode, but instead not only is it not being reduced, it is somehow oxidizing the cathode through what i suppose would be the salt bridge, and this doesn't appear to have any negative effects.

"can someone just check my answer for me?question: a bag contains 3 green balls, 5 red balls, 7 white balls and 9 black balls. five balls are drawn and then replaced each time. determine the probability of drawing five white balls in a row. state whether the events are dependent or independent.



my answer: 

 s = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9

 	= 24

 

 n = 7





p1 = n1/s1

	= 7/24



probability = p1 x p2 x p3 x p4 x p5

		= 7/24 x 7/24 x 7/24 x 7/24 x 7/24

		= 16807/7962624 (0.21%)



the events are independent because the marbles are being replaced.

i was reading about the shor's algorithm lately and it goes like for a guess x, x^(p/2) +- 1 are actually multiples of factors of n. 

one explanation for this was that we should actually check it with some examples. so 3^4 is congruent to 1mod10 2^3 is congruent to 1mod7.
then they generalized it for all positive integers saying that any x^p is congruent to a 1mod(mn) where m is some multiple.

"number of separable preferences for (n) issues in voting domains (explained inside the post)hey all! so, i was reading about ""separable preferences"" in voting domains. a little background on setting:

let's consider we have *n* (binary) issues and some voters who vote for either 0 or 1 (since binary issues) for each issue. we shall consider the combinatorial domain of preferences on all issues instead of one issue at a time (i.e., alternatives = d1 x d2 x d3, where d1 is domain of issue 1). 

&amp;#x200b;

a ranking order is *called as separable preference* if the preference of a voter for an issue (i) is same for every combination of alternatives of other (-i) issues. an example is,

111 &gt; 011 &gt; 101 &gt; 001 &gt; 110 &gt; 010 &gt; 100 &gt; 000

here, voter prefers alternative 1 to 0 for every issue (i) irrespective of the combinations of other issues {1,2,3}\\{i} i.e., 

**1**11&gt; **0**11,    **1**01&gt; **0**01,     0**1**1&gt; 0**0**1,     10**1**\&gt; 10**0** etc

informally, if a voter has separable preferences, he would just report the same top alternative that he has in combined domain when the issues are treated separately (single domain) i.e., if 110 is top alternative, he would report 1 for issue 1, 1 for issue 2 and 0 for issue 3.

now surely this order is not unique. so, i was just interested in finding how many such orderings are possible with the restriction of ""separable preferences"".

&amp;#x200b;

i worked on it and found that for every preferred (or top) alternative (eg: 111, there are 8 such), we have 48 such possible combinations which are separable. here's my work:

&amp;#x200b;

solving for 111 as top alternative,

obviously 111 should be placed at first position and 000 at the end of ranking. we need to fill the remaining 6 positions. if we observe clearly, we have 2 types of numbers (or alternatives) among the remaining 6. which are type 1 (110, 101, 011) and type 2 (100, 010, 001). clearly, each alternative from type 1 (eg: 110) is preferred to two alternatives in type 2 (010, 100) and is not comparable to the remaining alternative in type 2 bundle (001). and we can't compare any two alternatives of same type. so, their respective ordering shouldn't matter. so, we can solve this in two steps

&amp;#x200b;

* 111&gt; (type 1) &gt; (type 2) &gt; 000

since nothing in type 2 is more preferred to type 1 bundle, this ordering is separable and there are 3! \* 3! combinations of this type, hence 36 combinations

* 111&gt; (**any two from type 1**)&gt; (that single alternative from type 2 which is not comparable to the remaining alternative from type 1, obviously, this specific alternative turns out to be opposite (or negation?) of the remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (*remaining alternatives from type 2*)&gt; 000

eg: 111&gt; (110, 101)&gt; (100)&gt; (011)&gt; (010, 001)&gt; 000

there are (**3c2\*2!**)\* 1\* 1\* (*2!*) = 12

&amp;#x200b;

hence, 36+12=48 combinations. this can be solved because of less number of issues and alternatives. but, how to extend this to a general setting (n issues, a alternatives)? any help is appreciated also feel free to point out if i committed any mistake above. thanks!",0
"productivity questioni work for a company that has recently significantly reduced the amount of time an employee spends on a transaction. we have data to back this up that logs how long an employee works on each transaction.

the distance between cars would be:d= (v\^2)/2a  (i know acceleration)

&amp;#x200b;

then, i thought, based on velocity, i can figure out the total distance until a car would not make it past the point because it was too far away. which is simply velocity\*time. then, the number of cars should be distance to the farthest car dividing by the spacing of individual cars.

&amp;#x200b;

however, that comes up with n = v\*t/((v\^2)/2a)

or, ignoring the known constants, n ∝ 1/v.

&amp;#x200b;

that  is counter intuitive to me. in my mind, there should have been a sweet-spot in the middle where going any faster is detrimental due to stopping distance, and any slower would be hurt by few vehicles being able to pass in the given time. i would expect as v approaches 0, that you would not get one whole car past the mark before the time was up, thus also going to zero. instead, as v approaches zero, i get infinite cars across.

"i found this formula for calculating how to pass on payment processing fees and it works but i don't understand whyi'm embarrassed by my lack of basic mathematical skill, but nevertheless, i'm a freelancer and have to be able to understand this.

for the work i usually do, i usually just invoice the amount i'm charging and ask clients to pay in to my bank account. i have a client who for various reasons has to use a credit card to pay contractors and they suggested i setup a paypal account for this purpose so they can pay me that way.

this works fine, but paypal charges a 2.6% payment processing fee. i pass this on to the client, but i didn't realise that there's actually a flaw in how i've been doing this.

my total fee for the job was $2850. i added a 2.6% surcharge for paypal's processing fees, and invoiced my client for $2924.1, (2850 * 1.026). this all seemed fine, but then when i received my payment, and paypal deducted their fee i found myself left with $2847.77, not $2850. i tried to work out why i was shorted $2.23 and realised it was because the $76.33 that paypal had charged me was 2.6% of $2924.1 not, $2850 which makes sense of course, because that's how much the client paid me as per my invoice. so i realised it wasn't as simple as just charging the amount*1.026 to get the total plus processing fees incorporated.

again, i'm in general pretty embarrassed about my lack of mathematical ability so i found myself having to look this up on google for an answer, not knowing how i'd calculate it myself. i found a solution, and i tested it with my latest invoice and sure enough it leaves me with exactly $2850 as it should do, except the problem is i don't understand *how* it works. i don't think i should just blindly use a formula i don't understand, especially not as the amount i'll be charging will differ from amount*1.026 which to me seemed the intuitive way to calculate, so i may find myself having to explain why the amount invoiced, is what it is, and i currently wouldn't be able to.

the formula i found was

a / (100 - fee percentage)  * 100

so in my case

2850 / (100-2.6) * 100 =2926.0780287

2926.0780287 * 0.974 = 2850

"question regarding base sets of numbers?????i’m not even sure if my question is being asked right, but i have stumbled in here on a layman’s quest to find the meaning of patterns in numbers...

i’ve realized that if you multiply any consecutive numbers by the same base10 number (0-9), and reduce the number by adding the remaining integers, you end up getting a pattern of numbers. i know it sounds kinda wonky but idk how else to explain it...

for example let’s take the base number 3

if i were to take random numbers such as 13, 14, 15, and multiply them by base 3, i would get 39, 42, and 45—reducing these integers by adding the digits to each other gets me 3, 6, and 9...

3 + 9 = 1 + 2 = 3

4 + 2 = 6

4 + 5 = 9


adding the next consecutive numbers 46, 47, and 48 would get me another cycle of 3, 6, and 9.

multiplying any number by a base 6 would get me consecutive combinations of 9, 6, 3...

"[algebraic geometry] dimension of sheaf fibrehi everyone, i posted a [question on mse]( earlier this week about proving the upper semi-continuity of the rank of the fibre of a sheaf. 

i've had an answer there, but don't fully understand the proof, and understanding the use of nakayama's lemma here seems important. i've asked a few questions about it in the comments, but it doesn't look like the poster has been able to get back to me. if anyone could shed some light on it that would be much appreciated.

if anyone has the time also, it'd be great to get some feedback specifically on my proof (it isn't as long as it looks, i've just tried to make everything really explicit). thanks in advance!",0

"beginning homotopy theory questions, these are not hw questions, they are questions my teacher told me to think about. i think i am wrong in a lot of places.. thank you in advance! :d 

* define π1(x,b): what are the elements, and what is the multiplication rule.
   * π1(x,b) is a fundamental group which is an equivalance class of loops that start and end at the base point b. x is a set. i'm not sure what the multiplication rule is, i know in a group its just an operation for any two elements of the group. so is the multiplication rule the same for fundamental groups? or does it mean like what homotopic with two ends the same? as in like, what defines a loop to be the same as another loop, or in the same equivalence class?

&amp;#x200b;

* true or false: if \[a\] and \[b\] are elements of π1(x,b) then \[a\]\[b\] = \[b\]\[a\].
   * i'm not sure about this. i learned in what groups are, which is a set with an operation that can be applied to every element in the set, and in groups they are only communitative if they are albeian, and it works for every element in the group. i'm not sure if this property works for fundamental groups, or it would only work if it is albein right? so i'm thinking false, unless it the group is albeian?  

* true of false: if x is a subset of y then π1(x,b) is a subgroup of π1(y,b).
   * i think this is true? i know that for z is a sub
* true or false: if x is a subset of **r**2 then π1(x,b) is the trivial group.
   * i think this is false.. i thought the trivial group is just like the constant function? so since x is a subset of r2 doesn't necesarially mean x is r1, in which case it would be the trivial group.

if *h(x) = f(g(x))*, and if *g(x)* is even, would that mean *h(x)* will always be even?

**answer 1 (my answer):**

lets say g(x) = x^(2)

lets say f(x) = x^(3/2)

therefore f(g(x)) = (x^(2))^(3/2)= x^(3) (because the 2's cancel out)

if h(x) = x^(3), then h(x) is not even

&amp;#x200b;

**answer 2 (book answer):**

*h(x) = f(g(x))*

*h(-x) = f(g(-x))*

*h(-x) = f(g(x))* (since *g(x) = g(-x)*)

therefore *h(x) = h(-x)*, so its even

the system of battle is: random number generate from the stat eg. speed stat 7 randomly generate a number from 1 to 7


here's how a battle plays out. 1 v 1. you generate a speed stat and so does your opponent. whoever has the higher number goes first. whoever had the highest attacks by generating from their attack stat. you have a choice to block which means generate from your defense stat. if you generate a higher number then the attack no health is taken away. if you generate lower than the attack its attack number - defense number then that's taken away from your health. you also have the choice to try to evade the attack. you generate from speed. then your opponent generates from attack precision. if attack precision is higher then speed the attack number is taken from your health. if speed is higher then no damage is taken. this continues until someone drops to 0 health 

if two people generate the same number on attack/defense no damage is taken. if two people generate the same number on speed/precision you generate again

"newton's laws confusionwhen considering forces in an elevator moving at constant speed, by newton's first law the sum of forces must be opposite and equal (so forces up equal the forces down). however, in [this]( photo, the tension in the elevator is given as mg + mg (where m is lift weight, and m is person's weight). by newton's third law, surely the reaction force of the lift on the person should cancel out as they are equal. so if i name the forces as follows

mg - weight of lift

mg - weight of man

t - tension

rm - reaction force between the man and the lift

"looking for the name/idea behind this theoretical computer science math problem somewhat like the knapsack problem that can be solved with dynamic programminganyone know what this problem is called/commonly known as?

imagine you have a group of k identical coins. imagine you have a non-decreasing function value, that takes in a number ranging from 1 to k (inclusive), and outputs a number. the function is non-decreasing, so value(1) &lt;= value(2) &lt;= value(3) and so on and so forth.

how can you group your coins in such a way that their total value is as large as possible?

this is hard to explain in words so let me try to give an example. imagine if we were doing this problem with k=8: so you have 8 coins, and you have the following value function:

* value(1) = 1

* value (2) = 5

* value(3) = 8

* value(4) = 9

* value(5) = 10

* value(6) = 17

* value(7) = 17

* value(8) = 20

different arrangements of your 8 coins can result in a different total value. for instance, if you split your 8 coins into 1, 3 and 4, then your total value = value(1) + value(3) + value(4) = 18. if you split your coins into piles of 2 and 6, the total value = value(2) + value(6) = 23. alternatively, if you just have one pile of 8 coins, then total value = value(8) = 20.

a valid output for this problem is a sequence of positive integers, such that the sum of those integers is equal to k.

the optimal output for this problem (what we want an algorithm to output) is the valid output that has the largest total weight.

"terminology questionso i've been trying to explain a graph.

basically, i've heard the argument that goes as follows:

"a little combination and permutationto give context, the distance between a set of interconnected nodes is expected to be calculated.  the first and last node can be disregarded in the permutation/combination calculation as they will be constant.  the nodes cannot be reused, and permutations can be disregarded.

1 nodes of {a} can yield the following results delimited by comma and return:

a

2 nodes of {ab} can yield the following results delimited by comma and return:

ab

a, b, c, d

ab, ac, ad and bc, bd, and cd

abc, abd, acd, and bcd

abcd

&amp;#x200b;

as you may be able to see in the pattern, the total paths of a given n set of nodes are:

1 + n + f(n) = total # of paths

where the \[1 + n\] represent the constant single full combination and total individual combination of nodes respectively, and the f(n) is what i'm trying to determine that yields proper results.  i have it on the tip of my tongue but i cannot seem to recall it.

given the following:

nodes | combinations

1 | 1

2 | 3

3 | 7

4 | 15

5 | 30 ?

can you extrapolate what the function would be in relation to the previous information?

n = # of nodes

no repeating of nodes

only combinations (order does not matter, distance will be equal regardless of ordinance)

each combination begins from the minimum nodes to the maximum nodes available

disregard the first and last node yielding a -2 to total amount of beginning node sets for a combination

"stokes theoremso, this week in calculus 3 we learned about divergence theorem and stokes (kelvin-stokes) theorem.  

the flux integral of a closed loop is equal to the surface integral of the curl of the vector field of any region bounded by that loop.  

the divergence theorem which stated that the flux through any surface is equal to the integral of the divergence through the enclosed volume. 

&amp;#x200b;

for stokes theorem, we were able to pick any surface that was bounded by that region.  if it was a circle, we could have used a cone, the disk, a hemisphere etc.  i am confused on if or how you could pick any volume bounded by the surface.  is it some higher dimensional interaction that we cannot see, but still possible?

&amp;#x200b;

i am an ee major and understand the use of the divergence theorem for calculating a charge, and using an arbitrary surface, but that is only because that charge is the source of the entire field.  is there some way of doing a similar arbitrary volume/surface for generic divergence theorem problems?

&amp;#x200b;

so let x0 be an element of x. let xn be a sequence that converges to x0. then f(xn) = d(xn, x0). as the sequence continuous, f(xn) gets closer and closer to 0, since xn is a sequence that converges to x0. 

&amp;#x200b;

so xn converges to x, means that for all e &gt; 0, the exists a number n, s.t. for all n &gt; n, d(xn, x) &lt; e.

and also f(xn) converges to 0, and so for all e &gt; 0, there exists a number n, s.t. for all n &gt; n, d(xn, x), treated as an element of the function f, converges to d(x0, x0) = 0, and so we find that d(f(xn), f(x) &lt; e.

"advanced npv questionso a basic npv is simply the sum of {c / (1+i)\^n} for each period of income in a cash flow. you can use excel's irr and npv functions to calculate these properly. once you have the period rate {i} you do not need the npv function per say to get to the next npv. you can simply take your initial cost, minus the principal on the next cash flow period, plus (initial cost \* periodic rate - interest on the next cash flow period) to derive at the next npv. this is called an npv roll forward.

&amp;#x200b;

the above holds true in most simple scenarios, however my issue is that i do not have an equal first period of cash flow as its shorter. to accommodate this i need to adjust the present value formula above so that it is {c / (1+i)\^(1-n+w)}, w = number of days between settle date and next coupon date / number of days within the period. essentially it is saying the first period is not a full period, there for needs to be &lt;&gt; 1 but .5 or whatever w works out to be. at this point i can determine all the npvs for each period using the adjusted formula and everything checks out. however, i can no longer do the npv roll forward approach as it doesn't get me 100% to the next npv. i feel like i need to adjust the npv roll forward formula to accommodate this w that was introduced into the present value formula above. not sure if it needs to be where the {initial cost \* periodic rate...then there is some math formula added... - interest on the next cash flow}.",0

"can you make a simple equation to eliminate artifactually large differences from a sample that contains ""circular"" numbering? explanation in comments.hi everyone,

i'll try to keep this short. i have a sample where numbers range from 0 to 179. 0=180=360 and 90=270. 

these numbers represent the axis of astigmatism of corneas. since astigmatism usually is ""regular,"" or of equal magnitude 180 degrees apart, we only measure from 0 to 179.


however, because the axis of astigmatism is something measured in degrees, the numbers at the end are actually very close to the numbers at the beginning (since it comes full circle). aka, 179 could also be considered to be -1, 175 could be -5, etc.


let's say i want to take the difference between two measurements: 52 and 50 - easy, the difference is 2. but if i want to take the difference between 179 and 1, the difference should be -2 instead of 178.

obviously, i could get the answer by subtracting 180 from 179 (as above) so that the numbers are closer to the starting point of 0, but i figured we could create an equation that would work with any numbers.

the problem only happens when comparing numbers at the beginning and end of the circle. 

the question is: **is there some way to make a simple equation so that if anybody looked at the measurements and used the equation, that they could easily find the true difference between the numbers?** i was trying to play around with absolute values but couldn't get it to work out perfectly for all numbers.

"card game stats questionthis is probably an easy one for you. i have a question about the statistics surrounding the new mulligan rule in magic the gathering card game, specifically as it relates to drawing a specific card in a multiplayer game. the new mulligan rule is shown below.

&gt;*to take a mulligan, a player shuffles their 7 starting cards in their hand back into their deck, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size (7), then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their deck in any order. once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player's opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. this process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. a player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards.*

in multiplayer games, you get 1 free mulligan, (so no putting cards back from your hand until after the second mulligan)

my question is about the card ""serum powder"". which says:

&gt;""any time you could mulligan and serum powder is in your hand, you may exile all the cards from your hand *(remove the cards from the deck permanently)*, then draw that many cards. you can do this in addition to taking mulligans.

so basically you could reset the cards discarded down to zero again. 

so my question is, in a 99 card deck, where there is only a single copy of serum powder, what are the chances of drawing the card on the way to mulligan-ing to zero? is it 56%?",0

so if ~15,000 chris smiths are alive in the us, what are the chances that a workplace would have 5 of them.

"is it possible to prove that the riemann hypothesis is undecidable?i am not sure if this will be intelligible; if not, please do not hesitate to ask a clarifying question.

&amp;#x200b;

so there is [this]( numberphile video were a guy talks about the gödel incompleteness theorem. he then goes on about undecidability in general and mentions that a strange way of proving rh would be to show that it is undecidable within our system of axioms. because if it is, it means that we won't find a counterexample to rh since in doing so the problem would become decidable, so there are no counterexamples and so rh holds. without being sure that this is the correct terminology, i use the word ""undecidable"" to qualify any statement that can't be proven right nor wrong in a given axiomatic system.

&amp;#x200b;

so essentially: ""if i prove that rh is undecidable, then it is decidable, because i then know it's true"". this makes me conclude that you can't prove that rh is undecidable, because otherwise you end up contradicting yourself. so there is my problem. either this trick of proving rh the guy mentions is essentially useless, or i am confused.

&amp;#x200b;

one way that i get this wrong could be that i mix up the instances when we confine ourselves to our axiomatic system (lets call it s) and the instances when we go outside to ""look in"". because it could be that the proof of rh undecidability in s is made outside of s. lets look closely at the steps of my reasoning to see what i mean (brackets for clarity):

1. assume that we can prove that \[rh is undecidable in s\] in s
2. then we have proof in s that we cannot disprove rh in s
3. then we have proof in s that there is no counter example to rh in s
4. then we have proven rh in s
5. then rh is decidable in s
6. in total, if we can prove that \[rh is undecidable in s\] in s, then rh is decidable in s
7. thus we can't prove that rh is undecidable in s

this reasoning seems robust, but the guy was maybe referring to a proof that \[rh is undecidable in s\] that is made outside of s, perhaps in a system s' that is stronger than s, in which case the above reasoning doesn't apply (§1 doesn't hold). but that would raise more questions: what would s' look like? at what point would we regard s' as elementary enough as to be convinced by the proof? or maybe my reasoning fails elsewhere?

&amp;#x200b;

the problem i have is ""is it possible to prove that the riemann hypothesis is undecidable?""; if yes where does my reasoning fail? if it fails in §1 the way i considered just above, then what about s'?

"does there exist a function that does this?hello, i know almost nothing about math, so please forgive me if this question is really stupid. 

background: recently i was playing a video game and wondered if it would be possible to quantify a player’s skill at the game, based on how likely they are to win against another player. so, for example, if player 1 has a 50% chance of winning against player 2, their skill would be equal, because they are evenly matched. i then arbitrarily determined that i have a skill of 1. 
based on common sense, the following should be true:

- if someone has a 50% chance of winning against me, his skill = my skill = 1.

- if someone has a 100% chance of winning against me, that’s impossible. unless that person is infinitely skilled there should be at least a chance that i’ll win.

- if someone has a 0% chance of winning against me, that’s also impossible. unless he has a skill of 0 there should be at least a chance that he’ll win.

that is about where my brain gave up. so, would it be possible to write a mathematical function that calculates a number for skill, given these assumptions? or were any of my assumptions wrong?

"two functions equivalent if they have equal values on an interval?this was a shower thought, but unfortunately i've been out of school for too long and my analysis skills are way too rusty for me to prove this one myself. curious if this is true:

let's say you have two real-valued, polynomial, continuous functions f and g. (keep them well-behaved!)

you also have some interval [a, b], with a &lt;&gt; b, such that for all numbers x in the interval, f(x) = g(x). in other words, there's a  interval over which the two functions have equal values, and that interval doesn't consist of a single point.

does this necessarily mean f and g are the same function?

it seems so, to me: having the same values over the interval means that their ""shape"" is the same. this suggests the derivatives (and all higher order derivatives) are the same as well, if you consider the derivatives as a description of the slope/curve behavior of the function. (i don't know this is true for sure, but it *seems* true.)

if that's true, then call y the ""first number just outside [a, b]"" which i am well aware is not a real thing -- take the limit as y approaches b from the right, etc. intuitively, if the shape of the curve over [a, b] is identical for each function, then the value just outside the interval should also be identical because the behavior of the functions as they ""exit the interval"" are the same. which means you can expand the interval to [a, y] with y &gt; b and still maintain the truth of the statement about the interval.

the same logic should apply with z approaching a from the left. accordingly, you can expand the interval to all reals, and therefore the two functions are equivalent because they have the same values over the entire set of real numbers.

this obviously breaks down if you have non-continuous functions or if your interval is only a single number. but if you keep to nice, well-behaved polynomial functions with a an arbitrarily large interval, this seems right.

you have a very large number of red and blue coins in a container such that the probabilities of picking them are:

r = 3/4
b = 1/4

you take 10 coins out and put them into a box. what is the chance that your box has exactly 4 red coins?

the way i'm thinking about it is kind of imagining the tree diagram. follow one branch of it where you get 4 red coins and then 6 blue coins the probability would be 

(1/4)^6 * (3/4)^4

for that particular branch. now that branch is just one of many ways of getting 4 red coins and so you have to multiply the probability by the number of ways you can get 4 red coins. i thought that for this you should use permutations since that probability is found by considering just one **order** of steps to get the desired outcome of 4 red, or one path down the tree. the actual answer is to use the combinations.

i think i've majorly confused myself here. i can accept that the number of combinations is the number of ways of getting r objects from a set of n. but for this i'm imagining abcd and getting ab, ac, ad, dc, db, cb. i don't see how it comes into this problem.",0

i know that, if f(x) were a velocity-time equation, then f'(x) would give me acceleration and the definite integral of f(x) would give me distance travelled.

but i don't understand what my teacher means and what the question means when it says ""interpret the physical significance of f'(p) = definite integral of f(x) from 0 to p"". is there some relationship here i'm not understanding?

""a positive test result was found in 40% of the cells studied. of these, 30% had the typical abnormal pattern and 10% had a variant abnormal pattern.""

these are the results we are describing;

     60 negative (or normal) cells

     30 positive cells w/typical pattern

     10 positive cells w/atypical pattern

   100 total cells

when i read the above description of these results, i think ""what about the rest of the positive cells?"" to me, it sounds like we are only describing 40% of the positive cells. once the phrase ""of these"" is used, the rest of the sentence is referring only the positive cells, right?

"why is this a thing?
today i was watching a video about 'life path numbers' in numerology. i found out something very interesting. i know nothing about math,so sorry if the question is stupid!

take a random date:
example 18.10.1995

add 18+10+1995 
you get: 2023
add the numbers like this: 2+0+2+3 
it equals 7

if you add the numbers like this:
1+8+1+0+1+9+9+5 
equals 34 and 3+4 is also 7

the second example is the proper way to calculate your 'life path number' according to the video(add up the numbers from your birth date until you get a single digit number) the first example is how i calculated it before watching the video.

i found it interesting,so i tried it with other dates and i always got the same numbers in the end. can you,math people excuse my broken english and explain why is this happening??",0
"can someone help me understand something i just read about how multiplying random variables?edit: turns out i should have just kept reading the textbook instead of spending hours searching for more info. they only mentioned it in a single sentence at the start of the chapter, but had a whole section explaining it in more detail that made it click for me at the end. they even had the formula i was looking for for an unbiased estimate of long term annualised returns based on horizon in the final subsection, [seen here]( reading a textbook that's talking about time-series stock price data and average returns. it talks about the difference between arithmetic average return and geometric average return. one of the things it says is that if you have a number of years of i.i.d. random returns you can predict the expected return for the next year as the arithmetic average of the historical returns. for example, if you have:

2015: r = 6%

2016: r = 7%

2017: r = 5%

2018: r = 6%

then, assuming that all years are i.i.d, the expected return in 2014 would be 6% (the average of all those years). this makes sense, since they're all taken from the same distribution, so it's like looking at previous rolls of a die to determine the average value obtained when rolling that die.

but then it talks about how the expected ear over a multiple-year period is not the same as the expected return for a single period. so even if you expect to earn 6% return on average every year from 2019 to 2022, you don't expect to earn:

    1.06^4 - 1 = 26.2%

over that four year period. instead the expected ear would be slightly less (something like 5.8% per year), so that the expected four year return would be:

    1.058^4 - 1 = 25.3%

the rationale is that because each year's return is a random variable, and multiple positive variances have a greater effect than multiple negative variances, the arithmetic mean is biased when used over multiple years.

i tested this in excel using randomly generated data from a normal distribution and can see that it's true. generating 10,000 random returns for three years with a mean return of 6.5% i can see that the average ear over a two year period is around 6.3-6.4% and the average ear over a three year period is around 6.25-6.35%.

i'd love to read more about specifically why this happens, because in my textbook it was only given as a footnote. their rationale doesn't seem to make sense to me because if positive variances had a bigger effect than negative variances wouldn't you expect the ear to be *larger* than the arithmetic mean? like by my intuition i'm imagining an example where you expected 6.5% return every year, but some years you got 7% and some years you get 6%. if you get 6.5% two years in a row as expected then you get 13.4% return. if you get 7% two years in a row by variance then you get a 14.5% return: a gain of 1.068%. if you get 6% two years in a row by variance then you get 12.4%, a loss of only 1.063%. so you would gain *more* on average over two years than you'd expect if it was a static 6.5% p.a., not less.

the other thing i'd like to be able to do is work out what the expected return actually is for an n-year period given the expected yearly return. all i know now is that it's less than the expected yearly return itself, but not by how much. i expect the 'how much' is calculated using the variance of the random variable, and it'd be great to see exactly how that works out.",0

"problem: price cut and more customers still results in revenue lossi'm working on an article in response to a piece that advocates for cutting the fares of the commuter train, as this would increase ridership by 33%. i'm arguing that this would still make for a loss in ticket revenue. could you please check my math to see if i did all of this correctly?

&amp;#x200b;

train fair is currently $4.25.

&amp;#x200b;

advocates are pushing for that to be cut down to $2.50, which (they suggest) would increase ridership by %33.

&amp;#x200b;

i argue that the increase in ridership (33%) does not make up for the $1.75 (41%) cut, and would make for a 22% loss in revenue.

for example, if 100 people ride at 4.25, the train collects $425. if 133 people ride the train at 2.50, the train collects $332.50.

our family regularly plays shanghai rummy, a matching game played with multiple standard card decks.

my grandma has always said that the number of decks used = number of players + 1. we generally have 4-8 players and for time/ease, we have always used the same cards/number of decks for every game, regardless of number of players. no one is 100% sure how many decks are in there, but it's either 5 or 6. 

recently, 3 of us were out of town and wanted to play, so we looked up the rules. the rules state for 3-4 players, use 2 decks and for 5 or more players, use 3 decks. 

would decreasing the number of decks impact playing time?

i wasn't sure how, or if, using fewer decks would change the length of time it generally takes to obtain matching cards each round.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm trying to calculate the speed of a moving sphere after it collides with a stationary sphere. collision will be ellastic and the stationary sphere will remain stationary. i can solve it analytically using lines and all but i'm trying to implement this on an fpga and the code will be written in verilog. so i'm stuck with integer maths and i can't use trigonometric functions and square root. in addition, i have a little time window to make the calculation so long calculations are problematic.

&amp;#x200b;

i have a solution that gives correct answers but it's a long and complex equation to synthesize as a circuit, so i need a simpler approach, that only uses addition and subtraction if possible. neither nor my friends came up with solution unfortunately. tha ball will be drawn on a screen.

&amp;#x200b;

known variables: 

* center of stationary ball
* center of moving ball at the instant of collision
* point of collision
* speed vector of moving ball:

1. for this vector we have two variables. first one is the amount of movement in the given direction in terms of pixels. second one is the amount of clock cycles that needs to pass before the ball moves and is redrawn on the screen. 
2. amount of movement is constant, that is, ball moves by 1 pixel in each direction when it's redrawn. to change the speed, instead of redrawing the ball after 500000 cycles, we redraw the ball after 400000 cycles so it seemslike it sped up and vice versa.
3. given above information, we can define the speed of the ball as: v\_x=1/c\_x and v\_y=1/c\_y where c is the amount of clock cycles required before the ball is redrawn.
4. one final note: you can ignor 1, 2, 3 if you don't understand and use a single vector v=(vx,vy). i can make the corrections hopefully.

p.s. what i'm looking for is to find the speed vector after collision, using only vector addition and subtraction if possible but of course all solutions are helpful and welcome. thanks in advance for reading this long post/question.",0

"trying to come up with a formula to calculate corrected differential pressure based on rate of flow.i work at an airport. i perform quality control checks on fueling equipment, one of which is a daily differential pressure (dp) check. (psi before filtration / psi after filtration) according to our guidelines, we must record observed dp, and we must also record *corrected* dp. 

corrected dp in this case represents what the dp would be at the maximum rated flow of the refueling unit. the maximum dp allowed at 100% flow is 15 psi. basically, we have to calculate the corrected dp to determine whether the dp would be above or below 15 psi if the unit were at max flow. i've asked for years what the formula was and nobody has been able to tell me. thus far, we've had to use a computer program that figures it out for us, and i'm tired of not totally understanding how it works. here is the info i know. 

we have something called a curve chart which shows the graph of the max dp at your observed flow rate. the line representing max dp is curved, hence the name, which also means it is an exponential function, because the differential pressure increases exponentially with flow rate. 

max dp at 100% flow is 15 psi. max dp at 50% is 6.5 psi. we'll say that flow rate (%) is x, and dp is y. basically, the line on the graph begins at (0,0) and ends at (100,15) while passing through (50, 6.5,) and i have no idea how they came up with this graph.

here is an actual example from april 30, 2019. a refueling unit with a max flow rate of 450 gpm (100%,) observed flow rate of 210 gpm (46.66...%,) and an observed dp of 2 psi, the corrected dp was 5 psi. 

it may as well be magic, apparently, because nobody can prove to me on paper how they came up with 5 psi. i'm about 13 yrs removed from any sort of advanced math, so i'm a bit rusty to say the least. i don't remember the last time i felt this dumb while trying to figure something out.

"what numbers are feasibility constructible?after a course in abstract algebra at university, we ended with a fun little topic: ruler and compass constructions. we showed with the algebra we had learned, that the constructible numbers are a field, closed under square roots.

my question, is what numbers are “feasibly” constructible in this way? by this i mean say i give you a unit length and designate a circle of radius n, in r^2 in which you may construct numbers, with only a ruler and compass.

clearly, no number greater than 2n can be constructed, as this would definitely not lie within the circle, but there seems no lower bound (if n&gt;2) as we can have 1+1, followed by 1/2, ... , (1/2)^m (as we can happily perform multiplication and division within the circle). would the answer be something to do with the primes less than n, in terms of the fractions we can generate?

"gentleman jack currency questionhi everyone! i am new to reddit and this is my first post.

&amp;#x200b;

**context:**

i have recently been watching the hbo television show gentleman jack and have been loving it. i live in canada, so there are already five episodes out and no spoilers but i have a currency question related to the show. the show is set in 1832 and the protagonist offers to sell her coal pits to a buyer. the price per acre that she offers is 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies). as the inflation rates have significantly changed from then, i was wondering how much this would be in today's currency for context when the characters are talking about prices on the show. i did some calculations last night and was wondering if the method needs to be better and if the answer i received is reasonable.

&amp;#x200b;

**problem and solution that i found:**

according to wikipedia, before 1971, british pounds were divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence, which makes 240 pence (rather than the current division of 100 pence today) per pound. so with the price at 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies) per acre, assuming that each pound is 240 pence (as its set in 1832), amount in pounds = 226\*240 = 54 240 pence, amount in shillings = 17\*12 = 204 pence and then there is 6 pence. the total is = 54 240 + 204 + 6 = 54 450 pence.

&amp;#x200b;

using this u.k. inflation calculator [ i divided 54 450/240 to get the amount in pounds it would be which is 226.875 (as it is unclear to me if this calculator accounts for the 240 pence in a pound pre-1971 issue). inserting this number into this calculator with the start year at 1832 and the end year at 2019, it's £25,190.91 per acre in today's currency. by using google's currency calculator, that would be $42, 854.78 canadian dollars per acre or $31,883.88 u.s. dollars per acre.

&amp;#x200b;

is this a reasonable answer? are there any adjustments that must be made to the calculations? is there a different approach i should have taken to the problem? please let me know!

"solve for y.given a government tax rate (x), how many hours of overtime per week at 1.5 times hourly rate would it take to break even after taxes? (assume that overtime is after 40 hours)

if i pay for the benefits as a deduction on my paycheck and my yearly salary is bumped up an exactly equal amount, there will come a certain number of hours (y) worked per week at which i recieved the benefit tax free. 

to clarify, the benefit is free with 40 hours worked per week, just pay the tax on the benefit come tax time.

the point of this equation is to figure out how many hours of overtime are required for the taxes to pay for themselves.



example: 
$20 an hour prior wage.
$1000 in health benefits given as a $0.50 raise (50 working weeks, 40 hours a week = salary based on 2000 hours)

new wage: $20.50
new healthcare benefit: $1000
tax rate = x


***above edited for clarity, below added as a solution. feel free to check my work.

x = tax rate
y = overtime hours needed per week for the ""benefits raise"" to also pay for it's own taxes.

y = (((1÷(1-x))×40)−40)÷1.5

"rules for generalized tensor algebra and calculusi'm attaching at the bottom an example of a derivation for momentum continuity to illustrate what i'm talking about.  it seems like eventually you get to a point in the multivariable algebra and calculus where the rules and notation are less standardized.  i feel like i'm missing a standard set of rules for how to deal with keeping track of tensor order and rank, and things like when are some operations commutative/distributive or not.  frequently i find myself having to scour wikipedia for obscure rules and identities that i've never heard of or seen before.  for example, today in this derivation i needed to look up what a dyad was (the multiplication of u\_vec with itself as an outer product) and how to take a divergence of a dyad.  i get the vague impression that inner products reduce the order of the tensor product and outer products increase the order of the tensor product, but i'm not entirely sure about how this stuff generalizes.  i'm also starting to work with optimization problems and needing to get way more familiar with generalized multivariable operations that map vector spaces to vector spaces, and generalized derivatives and gradients where you specify what you are taking it with respect to.

"n people, how many ways are there to choose a committee of n peopletwo students are given the following problem: from n people, how many ways are there to choose a committee of n people, with one person chosen as the president? one student gives $n\\binom{n}{n}$, while the other student gives an answer of $n\\binom{n-1}{n-1}$.

by writing out the binomial coefficients, show that the two answers are equal.     

the binomial coefficient states that $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

thus in the first students case: $n\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{nn!}{n!(n-n)!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-1)!(n-n)!}$.

 in the second students case: $n\\binom{n-1}{n-1} = \\frac{n(n-1)!}{(n-1)!\[(n-1)-(n-1)\]!}$

which can be simplified to $\\frac{n!}{(n-1)!\[(n-1)-(n-1)\]!}$.

if we set the two equal to eachother we get: $\\frac{n!}{(n-1)!(n-n)!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-1)!\[(n-1)-(n-1)\]!}$

"equation/theory for sorting people into groups and reshuffling them into groups with unique people 

hello all!

i am trying to generate randomized teams with a caveat that each sorting will maximize the number of new people together on a team. this is for a school orientation where we are trying to get people to meet as many new people as possible

background info: this is for setting up groups for multiple activities in a day. we will have 1 activity where we divide all the people into teams for the event. for the next activity, we want to divide people (same group as in the first activity) into different teams (of a different number of people per team from the first activity) but maximize the number of new exposures so that people are on teams with new people. then do it again for a third set.

current thoughts: i was thinking of assigning random values to the groups each time then just sorting by number and making teams this way, but that does not guarantee any level of maximal exposure. the maximal exposure part is what i currently struggle with. i am able to get two unique groups simply with excel but cannot figure out how to make the third group unique.

this was my thinking:

the number of ways to arrange the answers randomly is 4^(100) because each question has 4 different possibilities.

say you put the sequence abcd on the first place. then you randomly put all the remaining answers down. this has 4^(96) possibilities. but then, the sequence abcd can go in any of 97 places, so the probability should be:

97\*4^(96)/4^(100)=97/256.

"what kind of ""rating system"" is this?not sure if askmath is the best place for this but i don't know where would be, if anybody knows point me in the right direction.

i'm curious what you would call a 1 to 10 rating system where 1 is your least favorite and ten is your favorite *within the parameters of a set of options where you have to have one of each.*

for example let's say i use this system to rate the sports baseball, basketball, hockey, and football. 

i really like all of these sports and they're my 4 favorite sports in the world, but out of these options baseball is my favorite and basketball is my least. so with this system i would rate baseball as 10, and basketball as 1, then place hockey and football within based on how they would scale to those, let's say 7 for hockey and 6 for football.

this rating system shows that i like baseball, hockey, and football a lot more than i like basketball, but i still like basketball. i'm not rating it a 1 out of 10 sport, i'm rating hockey and football based on how they fit between my favorite and least favorite.

i hope i explained that right, kind of hard to describe what i'm looking for.",0

"why don't we extend algebra to deal with division by zero and infinity?would this be useful? it seems like the contradictions you run into come from trying to reduce e.g. x / 0  when maybe you just shouldn't. why don't we just use rules like this with real numbers, zero type numbers, and infinity type numbers?

1 / inf = 0 = zero(1)

0 / inf = 0\^2 = zero\^2(1)

1 / inf = 0 \* 1 = zero(1)

0 / 0 = 1

x \* 0 = zero(x)

x / 0 = inf(x)

x / inf = zero(x)

x \* inf = inf(x)

0 / x = 1 / inf(x) = inf\^-1(1 / x) = zero(1 / x)

zero(x) = 1 / inf(x) = inf\^-1(x)

"difference between algebra and arithmeticso i'm in a reddit disagreement with someone who is claiming that every logical calculation in every day life is algebra.

my argument against this was (my verbatim comments is in italics)

*define ""algebra"" on google gives this ""the part of mathematics in which letters and other general symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.""*

*wikipedia gives this ""in its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols""*

*so far every source i've come across states that algebra is the solving of problems via symbolism and manipulating symbolism. most also go further to say that most word problems can be solved arithmetically or with algebra. what you seem to be saying here is that applying any form of calculations in real life is algebra?*

this is not the complete back and forth but i also gave two examples to ask for clarification on the difference between algebra and arithmetic.

&gt;*so $100 for 10kg = $10/kg is algebra and 100 divide by 10 = 10 is arithmetic?*  
&gt;  
&gt;yes, 100/10=10 is arithmetic. having $100 and 10 kg and solving for x number of dollars per kg and knowing how to set up the arithmetic to solve for x is algebra.  
&gt;  
&gt;*20mg of mg of protein in 60ml of urine is 20/60. isn't that the entire equation?*  
&gt;  
&gt;no. 20mg/60ml=0.33mg/ml is the whole equation. and again, 20mg/60ml = x mg/ml, solve for x is what you’re doing really quickly with basic math, but setting up that equation and solving for the unknown is algebra. someone could say the answer is 60/20=3, and their arithmetic is right (because 60 divided by 20 does equal 3), but their algebra is wrong because they solved for the wrong thing (x ml per mg instead of x mg per ml)

lastly, i also stated that ratios and fractions can be taught and understood without algebra and that there are both algebraic and arithmetic fractions which means that they are quite different forms of math beyond algebra just giving units or meanings to simple arithmetic.

this is the entire comment chain for transparency.   [ was getting massively downvoted with only the initial commentor explaining to me why i could be wrong. i don't care about the downvotes. i'd just like some clarification on this topic to make sure my understanding of algebra, arithmetic and number-logic is correct.",0

i am really confused at this part. first of all, i don't understand how it is possible to find anything in common between two events and the complement of the other, since the complement is the event that the opposite happens.

how can does (a1 ∩ a2 ∩ a3^c) share anything in common with each other? i can see what a1 and a2 have in common with each other, and that is that their subjects survived, but it is an intersection of all three, so how can they have an intersection if they don't all have something in common?

"discrete mathematics questions - probability, combinatorics, rsa encryption, etc.hi everyone, i have a couple questions that i'm quite unsure of and i'd appreciate some help.

&amp;#x200b;

**question 1** \- a grocery store stocks 1-gallon cartons of skim milk, 1% milk, 2% milk, and whole milk. a customer is asked to buy 10 gallons of milk. the customer needs to buy at least one carton of each type of milk.

how many different ways can the kinds of milk to buy be selected?

&amp;#x200b;

a: 120

b: 84

c: 210

d: 286

&amp;#x200b;

there are 4 different types of milk. we must acquire 10 in total with at least 1 of each type. once the 4 are chosen, then we have 6 remaining gallons to acquire. doesn't the question essentially ask what are the different ways we can choose the remaining 6 gallons from the 4 different types?

in that case, since there are 4 different options for each gallon and 6 gallons to be chosen without regard to arrangement, wouldn't that give us 4\^6/6? (obviously incorrect because it is too large)

&amp;#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**question 2** \- a random experiment consists of tossing a fair 6-sided die repeatedly.

how many tosses are required to be certain that the probability that at least one '6' appears is greater than or equal to 1/2?

a: 3

b: 5

c: 6

d: 4

&amp;#x200b;

a single toss of a fair die would give us a probability of 1/6 to get a 6. if we toss it 3 times, we would get 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 chance to get a 6 so that answer is a. is this correct?

&amp;#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**question 3** \- n is an integer between 0 and 9.

for how many values of n does \[123,3n2\] = \[0\] mod 8, where 123,3n2 is a six-digit number?

a: 2

b: 5

c: 4

d: 3

&amp;#x200b;

are we suppose divide all variations of 123,3n2 by 8 and see if there are any remainders to determine the number of times 8 evenly divides 123,3n2? in that case, 8 evenly divides the different variations of 123,3n2 4 times so the answer is c, correct?

&amp;#x200b;

also, why are there square brackets around those numbers - i've never seen them in my reading material but for some reason they show up on the sample test? 

&amp;#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**question 4** \- let n = 12 = (2\^2) + (2\^3)

&amp;#x200b;

given that (m\^2) = 51 (mod 59), what is (m\^12) (mod 59)?

&amp;#x200b;

a: 7

b: 36

c: 3

d: 30

&amp;#x200b;

is there some kind of mistake? they assign n in the beginning but then the problem is in terms of m. anyway, i am quite lost on what to do here. i would appreciate help. how can i tie this information together to get the answer?

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**question 5** \- given the characteristic equation: x\^(n + 1) = 2x\^(n - 1), what is it when expressed as a explicit function?  


a: 2 + 2\^n

b: 3 + n x 2\^n

c: 3 + n x 2\^(n + 1)

d: 1 + 2\^(n + 1)

&amp;#x200b;

when i divide the equation by x\^(n - 1), i get x\^2 = 2. if i subtract 2 to both sides, i get (x\^2) -2. at this point, i would usually factor the polynomials to get the value of x but i'm not sure how to do so cleanly so i'm stuck here.

"reasoning behind the probability in a random dice systemi'm curious as to *why* a random dice system i analyzed is showing the results it did.

to put a long story short, i analyzed the probabilities involved in a random dice system that another group created, suspicious that their system wasn't actually evenly balanced between two choices (which is what they try to maintain).

----------------------------------------

here are the rules:

1) two players choose a ""threshold"" with a range of 100, limited between 0 and 999. for example, player one chooses a threshold of 0-100, while player 2 chooses a threshold of 600-700.

2) each player rolls a 999-sided die, and compares the results.

3) the higher roll wins, except when the roll falls within their threshold.

3a. - a roll within the player's threshold will win over a roll outside a threshold, no matter what. for example, player one with a threshold of 0-100 rolls a 50, while player 2 with a threshold of 600-700 rolls an 800. player one wins, for being in their threshold.

3b. - if both players roll inside their threshold, the higher number wins.

----------------------------------------

i ran a simulation of each threshold playing against each other threshold 100,000 times, and these were the results:

threshold of 0-100 secured victory against:
...
average win rate = 53601 

threshold of 100-200 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 52790.1 

threshold of 200-300 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 52006.2 

threshold of 300-400 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 51196 

threshold of 400-500 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 50356.5 

threshold of 500-600 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 49563.8 

threshold of 600-700 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 48740.4 

threshold of 700-800 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 47984.5 

threshold of 800-900 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 47120 

threshold of 900-999 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 46379.3 

the tendency for lower thresholds to win is evident, and stays true no matter how many times i run the simulation.

my question is... why? what's the reason behind this discrepancy? i feel as though i have a vague understanding, but i can't quite cement it, or put it into words. can anyone help me to better understand this?",0

so i ran across this equation that my stuff doesn't like:

ve = vo + d * ( r x l )

so it seems to me, that ""r x l"" would be a vector that is in radian*meters/second rather than merely meters/second.  that instead of the top part of r being radians, it should be unitless so that the overall units end up m/s like the velocities.

&amp;#x200b;

1a 9.8.1

1b 5.3.1

1c 8.6.4

&amp;#x200b;

the batches of three are variable, so another question might look like this:

&amp;#x200b;

2a 9.5.4

2b 8.7.3

2c 6.2.1

&amp;#x200b;

now i have already figured out that i can represent the answer statements like this.

&amp;#x200b;

for example question 1

&amp;#x200b;

1a 9.8.1: 110000001

1b 5.3.1: 000010101

1c 8.6.4: 010101000

&amp;#x200b;

i will add to this 10 to the beginning, so when each question get ticked, this number will incrementally update with 1.

&amp;#x200b;

so i have the following series for question 1

&amp;#x200b;

10110000001

10000010101

10010101000

&amp;#x200b;

now my question is the following: i wanted to redirect users based on the score that they have, but i don't think that is possible with the the operators that are available to me. i can just say: when a certain number is greater or lesser than x, redirect the user to answer y.

&amp;#x200b;

since this is not possible, what i am looking  to redirect them based on an exact score. i can redirect like: when x is equal to y redirect to z.  in other words: i need a of list every combination of answers.

&amp;#x200b;

i am looking if someone can help me create this list, or if it is easy for someone who can help me.

my list is here:

"i have a weird question(s) having to do with the fibonacci sequencei was once in my friend's studio looking at a barrel. i got to thinking about fun ways to paint the barrel. i've always been fascinated with the fibonacci sequence and thought ""what if i painted the first slat, skipped the next, painted the next two, skipped the next three, etc."" 

i realized that in order to paint the whole barrel, i'd be doing quite a few second coats. from there, the question expanded. how many laps around a barrel of slat number n would it take to paint the whole barrel, following the rule paint, skip per corresponding fibonacci term? i took to the notepad, and things got hairy. 

if we let n denote number of barrel slats, ""turn"" denote how many times around the barrel until all painted, and ""fib"" the fibonacci term that finishes the barrel, you get (forgive formatting, am on mobile):

n=5; turn=3, fib=5
(paint slat a, skib b, paint c d, skip e a b, paint c d e a b &lt;--- all slats painted)

n=6; turn=2, fib=5
n=7; turn=4, fib=13
n=8; turn=3, fib=13
n=9; turn=3, fib=13
n=10; turn=3, fib=13

and so on until

n=14; turn=5, fib=34

excusing that this is just a curiosity, and probably a silly one at that, is there a more formal way to represent this? is there an extant investigation? which branch of mathematics should i go read about to get closer to understanding?

i think my original question was wondering whether there would ever be any n at which at least one slat would always be unpainted, but now i'm more curious as to whether there is any pattern or predictive formula to describe the relationship between n, turn, and fib.

question: solve: 9\*tan(2x) - 18\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

here's what i did:

&amp;#x200b;

factor out a 9 and divide both sides by 9 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200b;

tan(2x) - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

replace tan(2x) with the double angle formula:

&amp;#x200b;

\[2\*tan(x) / 1 - tan\^2(x)\] - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

multiply all terms by 1 - tan\^2(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200b;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x)\[1 - tan\^2(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200b;

distribute 2\*cos(x) to each term in the brackets:

&amp;#x200b;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x) + 2\*tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

factor out a 2 and divide both sides by 2 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200b;

tan(x) - cos(x) + tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

replace all tan(x) with \[sin(x)/cos(x)\] and cancel one of the cos(x):

&amp;#x200b;

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos\^2(x)\]\*cos(x) = 0

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200b;

multiply all terms by cos(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) - cos\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

replace cos\^2(x) with \[1-sin\^2(x)\] and simplify:

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) - \[1-sin\^2(x)\] + sin\^2(x) = 0

sin(x) - 1 + sin\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

2\*sin\^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0

&amp;#x200b;

factor this as a quadratic equation:

&amp;#x200b;

(2\*sin(x) - 1\]\[sin(x) + 1\] = 0

&amp;#x200b;

set each factor = 0 and solve for x:

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) = 1/2

x = pi/6 or 5pi/6

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) = -1

x = 3pi/2

&amp;#x200b;

these solutions are correct, but so is x = pi/2. why doesn't this solution show up in my work? where did i go wrong?",0

a: volume of substance one, in millilitres  
b: concentration of substance one, in milligrammes per ml  
c: volume of substance two, in ml  
d: concentration of substance two, in mg/ml  


x: total volume of substance one and substance two, in ml  
y: product concentration, in mg/ml  


the formulas are:   
( a \* b ) + ( c \* d ) = x \* y  
a + c = x  


wherein b and d, and x and y are defined by user input.  the concentrations of the two substances are known, as are the desired total volume and desired end concentration.  the values of a and c are the ones i'd like to be able to work out.  


i'm able to come up with formulae for solving for any one variable.  e.g.:   
a = ( c \* ( y - d ) ) / ( b - y )  


... but that's dependent upon another variable i'm trying to solve for, var c .  so i can't plug that into an excel spreadsheet because it can't crank out a value if there's an unknown in there.    


here's an example using known values:   
a = 1 ml  
b = 100 mg/ml  
c = 2 ml  
d = 25 mg/ml  
x = 3 ml  
y = 50 mg/ml  


therefore: ( 1 ml \* 100 mg\\ml ) + ( 2 ml \* 25 mg\\ml ) = 3 ml \* 50 mg\\ml   


i know that there's only one possible solution (no pun intended) for vars a and c, if given the concentrations of one and two, the desired concentration, and the desired volume.

here's a snapshot of the excel spreadsheet in progress: yellow fields are user input, grey fields are calculations, and orange fields are for calculated output.  at this point, i put values into the 'output' fields so the 'calculation' fields could have something to chew on.

"if h/k is a rational number, which of the following must be true?    i. h is an integer

    (a) i only

    (c) iii only
    (d) i and iii only

i thought (c) because e.g. h = 2.1, k = .3 reduces to 7 which is rational. other sources say i is true as well and thus claim the answer is a. all the problem says, though, is that h/k is a rational number, and i know a rational number can be expressed as a quotient of integers, but can't rational numbers also be expressed as quotients of non-integers as well (even if that's not what defines them as rational)?

"generalized mean of a function?so the generalized mean can be written like this:

however, the generalized mean of a function confuses me because i'm not sure where the new function would go. maybe just apply it to both sides, but then it's not really mean of the function, rather function of the mean. i assume once i know where the new function would go i just add the probability density function in its place, but then the fraction shouldn't be there so i'm not really sure how all these are related. is weighted mean just an entirely different thing?",0

"levi civita on a geometric manifoldhi guys, i ran into a question while reading some stuff on differential geometry, and got confused by some posts online. i was hoping to find some help here.

&amp;#x200b;

consider the levi-civita tensor on a manifold, identified on the tangent plane locally. since we have the covariant and contravaraint forms of the tensor, i was curious about whether there were identities relating the levi-civita tensor (or a product of 2 of them) to the metric itself. further, i was also curious about taking local coordinate derivatives ($\\partial\_{x\_j} \\text{det}g$) of the determinant of the metric with the levi-civita tensor method.

 essentially, we could ignore the levi-civita symbol while taking partials through any of these operations, right?

"what is the complexity-class (p, nphard, etc) of this category of unitary transforms from n bits to n bits of reversing xor(in,out) of sequence of (n choose m)*((2^m)!) unitary transforms of m bits to m bits, chosen randomly from ((n choose m)*((2^m)!))! poss unitary transforms of n bits to n bits?for example, if m is 4 then there are ((2\^4=16)!)=20922789888000 possible unitary transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits, and if n=256 then there are 256 \* 255 \* 254 \* 253 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 =  174792640 combos of 4 bit vars of n bits, each of which has 20922789888000 possible unitary transforms. if we take all those pairs of {combo of 4 bit vars} and {possible unitary transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits} and choose a random order of those, then its still within polynomial and not nphard if m=4 is constant, and the whole sequence has exactly 2 \^ n possible inputs and 2 \^ n possible outputs, though not all possible unitary transforms of n bits to n bits are in there, i strongly suspect exponentially many of the hard-to-reverse ones of them are.

more optimizable, instead of ((2\^4=16)!) transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits, the majority op on 3 bits to 1 bit, with all 8 choices of not vs identity, costs 2 bits to 4 choose 1 then costs 3 bits to not vs identity so costs only 32 possible unitary transforms and is still nphard since any nphard transform can be built of combos of majority op with optional nots, and there is no bias of specific values of the 3 bits read since all 8 not vs identity of them are used in 32 possible transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits. or if you dont trust this optimization you could stick with all the ((2\^4=16)!) possible transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits.

my question is, what is the complexity-class of reversing something derived from both the input and output of this unitary transform of n bits to n bits, such as the n input bits xor the n output bits? since its trivial to calculate forward or backward (but not both at once), i strongly suspect that reversing the xor of input and output is nphard and therefore proof that p!=np... but strongly suspecting is not proving. i'm not sure how to proceed in such a proof?

"basic meal prep math question?hi! so i have a weird and probably super simple math question i'm tangoing with.

i'm making a big meal prep spread sheet, and i've crunched down the calories and macro-nutrients of a recipe using a ratio format, with the key ingredient being the primary factor "" 1:x:y:z "" . for example, i'll have a recipe based around 1lb of chicken with all other ingredients are in ratios relative to said 1lb of chicken to keep cooking / scaling simple for large, multiple person meal prepping. the issue i'm running into is finding an optimal way to make calorie-tight serving sizes. i find out how many servings of ""x"" calories i can make, but every way i've come up with to separate the remainder / leftover seems like it may be more complicated than it needs to be.

for example, i have one ""recipe / ratio"" which comes out to about 1826 calories, dividing into 3.652, five-hundred calorie portions. what i want to figure out is the easiest way to, in the real world, divide my 1826 calories of food into 3 even portions with the remainder of 0.652 of a meal. the unit of measurement of course will be weight, which i don't have at the moment (which should be able to be mathematically translated from the calories themselves).

my attempts and why they suck:

round up to the next # of portions. (so 3.65 rounds to 4). so if our recipe is 1826 calories, this makes four 456.5 cal servings. we know we want to end up with 3.65 total servings, so we take 0.35 of the fourth serving and distribute it among the original three. this isn't accurate as you have to distribute the 0.35 among the 3 full meals and the 0.65 of a meal itself. i know i'm missing some super elementary details to make this work but i can't figure out what exactly  and it makes me feel dumb lol.

the other thing i tried that does work is dividing all 1826 calories by 3 portions, leaving me with 608.66 calories per portion. from there i could remove the extra 108.66 calories, or 17.85% per serving. this actually works, (which i just figured this out as i was creating the post), but i was still wondering if there is more elegant math or an equation i can plug in that might tell me how to portion things out from the beginning.

tl;dr:

the idea is to cook the 1826 calories worth of food, weigh it, and then divide it into three 500 calorie portions with the 0.65 remaining off to the side in it's own mini portion for calorie tracking purposes. i have some ways to do so but i want to know if you smart folks have a more elegant solution.",0

"formula for generating a tilted discbackground: i am building a 3d modeling solution that is bone first and model second. usually the model is made first and a skeleton for animation is created second. i'm exploring the wonderful world of procedural content and ran into an issue with my current solution. 

what i have now: i found a formula that uses radius, theta, and phi to get the x,y,z coordinate for a point on a sphere. it is...

    x = radius * sin phi * cos theta
    y = radius * sin phi * sin theta
    z = radius * cos phi

my theta and phi are based on the current iteration index multiplied by the number of radians i need per iteration to reach 2pi. the other is some constant fraction like pi/2 or 5pi/4. different combinations of 1 being constant and the other being iterative gives me a good variety of angles, but the issue is that the solution does not work for 3d rotations that are not aligned to at least 1 axis. i figure that is because of the constant value during iteration, but when i try to iterate both values i end up with something crazy. 

my goal: what i have now allows me to generate a disc tilted an arbitrary amount with a single iteration. i want to be able to create a disc of points and in that same iteration calculate their xyz for their final rotation. traditionally one would generate a disc facing y+ and then do rotation. or for a *modern* solution, generate the disc, parent the disc to a transform, and rotate the transform. i would like to avoid having to do something like that. 

some college friends suggested quaternions but i'm not sure how to use them on a set of points or on individual points as they're being generated. if there is some other solution or a way to get the solution i have now to work, i'd really like to know! thanks. 

a simple example, i would like to be able to create a ring if points the surface of which is perpendicular to the angle between the points (0,0,0) and (5, 10, 10).

--edit: a few more details that come to mind

i'm targeting webgl for the first build. i am not against doing this in multiple steps, i just care about performance. if creating a disc facing y+ and then using a rotation matrix to move all the points will be more performant than doing several sin/cos/etc calculations to get the final point in a single step i have no problem going with that. and since this is a math forum i wouldn't expect that concern to be taken into account and i would be happy to benchmark multiple solutions to see what works best!

--edit 2: i'm targeting webgl so i have threejs to make some boilerplate stuff simpler. i just found out that the geometry buffer class's lookat implementation applies a transform to its geometry instead of itself (like unity transform would). so i think i will be able to get away with generating a circle of points, setting them as the geometry data for the geometry buffer, using lookat to move the points, and then adding the tilted points to my target mesh. i will bench mark this against my current flawed solution to see how much overhead (?) this step adds. might also be worth checking the underlying implementation and using that directly so i don't have to construct a geometry buffer.

can any of you guys help me with a problem? i have a pirates chest that i like to keep my coin collection in. i store mainly half dollars (diameter:  30.61 mm thickness:  2.15 mm ), quarters (diameter: 24.26 mm  thickness: 1.75-mm), dimes (diameter: 17.91 mm  thickness: 1.35 mm  )  and silver dollars (diameter: 40.6 mm  thickness: 2.98 mm )

the internal diameter of the box is 28 inches long, 16 inches high and 18 inches wide.

assuming i store my coins in there like a pirate would, and assuming i store equal dollar amount of each coin can anyone break down the number of each coins? 

this is one of those things that i have been wondering, but have no idea how to calculate 

(these are calculations for silver coins...i will never fill the thing full, but for my own curiosity i’d like to know how much loot would fit in my chest)

"[trigonometry] represent normal vector with angle in three-dimensional spacei'm sorry if this question is a bit abstract. but basically in two dimensional space you can represent a normalized vector with an angle, like this.

     (cos ⍺, sin ⍺)

also you can draw a circle with radius of 1 and any normalized vector will lie on that circle.

i'm wondering if you can represent a vector in three dimensional space in similar fashion, with an angle? and would it be correct to assume that all the normalized vectors in this space lie on a sphere with radius of 1?",0
"calculating the volume with integrali want to calculate the volume on a bottle of wine with integral. but i got stuck on the bottleneck.

prove: c is perpendicular to alpha.

in maths book it is proven with vectors, but i think i can do it by using other axioms and definitions.

1) in a, b and d there are atleast 3 points (a, b and c) that are not in one line.
2) in a, b and c there can only be one and only plane. plane beta.
3) if d is perpendicular to alpha, then d is perpendicular to b and c.
4) d belongs to beta, so then beta is perpendicular to c and b, therefore beta is perpendicular to alpha.
5) c is perpendicular to a, because c belongs to alpha and a belongs to beta.

"calculating grade needed for athis seems a little complicated and i am not sure of the method. also, it's thankfully not for a math course.

so the syllabus indicates 6 categories of grades, and each category will average all the grades given for projects and homework in that category. then those averages are weighted according to how much % that category is of the final grade.

categories are weighted as follows:

1. 25% midterm portfolio review
1. 20% sketchbook exercises
1. 10% critiques
1. 25% major projects average
1. 10% class participation
1. *10% dropped category*

**100% final average** (not a category)

now, what complicates matters is that one of the categories was for an assignment the instructor dropped, due to lack of time. so the other 90% need to be ""redistributed"" to become the whole 100% of what we will be graded on. i am not sure how to do that.

here are my current averages, by category:

1. 80
1. 100
1. 100
1. --- (see below)
1. 100 (hopefully)

only one grade is remaining for this class, for the final project. and it'll probably make or screw me out of an a. its category (4) is averaged out of 3 grades, and the two i have in it so far are 75 and 95.

"convergence rate of euler integrationhey everyone,

i'm doing numerics and i'm simulating a simple linear pendulum with eulers method.

i understand that the convergence of euler is 1, meaning that by halving the stepsize dt, the accumulated error at a certain time should halve as well.

i simulated the pendulum for one period and then examined the accumulated error for different dt. in my calculations, the convergence rate is much higher than 1, actually roughly 2.2. is that normal? is the convergence rate just a lower bound? (i also tried it with half a period and 100 periods)

i'm really confused by this. i also implemented runge kutta methods, and with them the convergence rate comes out precisely as expected.

edit: here is a plot of the residual against the used time step

 figured it out. when running the system only for a quarter period t/4 and compare the numerical solution to the analytical result, i recover the convergence rate of 1 for the euler.

i'm guessing in this simple system, when going through the entire sine wave, some of the accumulated errors somewhat cancel out.",0

"probability questionhey, everyone! i've been trying to find a fair way to balance rolling for stats in d&amp;d.   
how i went about this is assuming the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) is the most balanced. that means an average of 12 and a combined total of 72. i originally went about it like this:   
72=6(x((y+1)/2)) or 24=x(y+1), where x=number of dice rolled and y=maximum possible roll.  
this originally didn't work since i wanted both x to be a positive integer and y to be an even integer. i fixed the problem by assuming you re-roll all 1s, making the new minimum 2:  
24=x(y+2)  
i plotted this function and found some really good settings that worked.   
x|y  
2|10  
3|6  
4|4  
the table means the players are offered a choice of rollings 2d10s, 3d6s, or 4d4s. on all of these rolls, players will re-roll all 1s.   
the problem i've encountered with my players is so far, the 3 players that have already rolled for stats have achieved totals above 72. all of them chose to roll 3d6s, re-rolling all ones.   


my question: are these actually fair ways to roll dice assuming a fair average is 12? is there something i'm not accounting for  that might change the average? if it is a fair way, how can i reduce the the variance in stat totals my players get?   
(as a heads-up, my guess is i did not account for standard deviation and i still would not know how to account for standard deviation in a probability question.)

\-the per agent sales goal amount

\-the average amount of time per connected call.

  


**sliding factors** (i have these internal metrics, but don't know how the optimal way to combine them to achieve the best buying strategy):

  


\-the contact rate i get at each 'bid' price level (how likely it is the 'lead' answers the phone, grouped by dollar amount) 

\-the conversion to sale rate at each bid price level

  


i realize this is complex, but i have feel like i have all the metrics here to put together an equation. example of the numbers below:

\-average call time per connected call: 10 minutes.

"not a math question but a question to mathematicians.as a student of economics (please don't stop reading out of disregard for my kind) i have heard that more 'sciency' people, specifically mathematicians or physicist, as they are so well educated in the mathematical realm, logic and reasoning (almost regardless of the domain), are criticising the logic in economics. i am not fully aware of what they mean, whether it is in the assumptions, in the reasoning for those assumptions (""on average true"") on the reasoning methods in causalities or what, i guess just pick what you want to criticise.

i myself am now interested, with the intent of improving that, at least in the areas of my interest, what's so fundamentally wrong in our reasoning that is laughable to call that science.

"need help converting value of $ to a virtual currencyi have a system that gives away ""tickets"" either for free over a span of time for watching a video stream for x amount of time, or they can buy tickets with tips, subscriptions, etc.

the issue is, this system needs to be profitable. anyone can eventually earn enough tickets to get the more expensive prizes for free (merchaindise other tangible items that costs physical $)

a subscription costs $5. i would like it to be possible to be able to earn roughly $5 worth of tickets over 3 months. ( 90 days )

so for 3 months, they will earn $1.66 worth of tickets per month. about 0.027$ per day.the tickets are distributed every 10 minutes over a span of 4 hours max. i cannot change this interval.

"conditional dice probabilityi'm trying to calculate (what i understand to be) hypergeometric distribution of d6's, given particular conditions at specific die pool numbers.
