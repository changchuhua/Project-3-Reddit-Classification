"Can someone just check my answer for me?Question: A bag contains 3 green balls, 5 red balls, 7 white balls and 9 black balls. Five balls are drawn and then replaced each time. Determine the probability of drawing five white balls in a row. State whether the events are dependent or independent.



My answer: 

 S = 3 + 5 + 7 + 9

 	= 24

 

 N = 7





P1 = n1/s1

	= 7/24



Probability = P1 x P2 x P3 x P4 x P5

		= 7/24 x 7/24 x 7/24 x 7/24 x 7/24

		= 16807/7962624 (0.21%)



The events are independent because the marbles are being replaced.

"Regarding the math of Shor's Algorithm.I am not sure if this should go into the AskCompSci subreddit since I have a doubt in the math. So here I go.

I was reading about the Shor's algorithm lately and it goes like for a guess X, X^(p/2) +- 1 are actually multiples of factors of N. 

One explanation for this was that we should actually check it with some examples. So 3^4 is congruent to 1mod10 2^3 is congruent to 1mod7.
Then they generalized it for all positive integers saying that any X^P is congruent to a 1mod(mN) Where m is some multiple. 

I wanted to ask what could be a better explanation for X^(P/2) +-1 being better guesses than X itself rather than just putting in values.

"Number of separable preferences for (n) issues in voting domains (Explained inside the post)Hey all! So, i was reading about ""Separable preferences"" in voting domains. A little background on setting:

Let's consider we have *n* (binary) issues and some voters who vote for either 0 or 1 (since binary issues) for each issue. We shall consider the combinatorial domain of preferences on all issues instead of one issue at a time (i.e., alternatives = D1 X D2 X D3, where D1 is domain of issue 1). 

&amp;#x200B;

A ranking order is *called as separable preference* if the preference of a voter for an issue (i) is same for every combination of alternatives of other (-i) issues. An example is,

111 &gt; 011 &gt; 101 &gt; 001 &gt; 110 &gt; 010 &gt; 100 &gt; 000

Here, voter prefers alternative 1 to 0 for every issue (i) irrespective of the combinations of other issues {1,2,3}\\{i} i.e., 

**1**11&gt; **0**11,    **1**01&gt; **0**01,     0**1**1&gt; 0**0**1,     10**1**\&gt; 10**0** etc

Informally, if a voter has separable preferences, he would just report the same top alternative that he has in combined domain when the issues are treated separately (single domain) i.e., if 110 is top alternative, he would report 1 for issue 1, 1 for issue 2 and 0 for issue 3.

Now surely this order is not unique. So, i was just interested in finding how many such orderings are possible with the restriction of ""Separable Preferences"".

&amp;#x200B;

I worked on it and found that for every preferred (or top) alternative (eg: 111, there are 8 such), we have 48 such possible combinations which are separable. Here's my work:

&amp;#x200B;

Solving for 111 as top alternative,

Obviously 111 should be placed at first position and 000 at the end of ranking. We need to fill the remaining 6 positions. If we observe clearly, we have 2 types of numbers (or alternatives) among the remaining 6. Which are type 1 (110, 101, 011) and type 2 (100, 010, 001). Clearly, each alternative from type 1 (eg: 110) is preferred to two alternatives in type 2 (010, 100) and is not comparable to the remaining alternative in type 2 bundle (001). And we can't compare any two alternatives of same type. So, their respective ordering shouldn't matter. So, we can solve this in two steps

&amp;#x200B;

* 111&gt; (type 1) &gt; (type 2) &gt; 000

Since nothing in type 2 is more preferred to type 1 bundle, this ordering is separable and there are 3! \* 3! combinations of this type, hence 36 combinations

* 111&gt; (**any two from type 1**)&gt; (that single alternative from type 2 which is not comparable to the remaining alternative from type 1, obviously, this specific alternative turns out to be opposite (or negation?) of the remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (*remaining alternatives from type 2*)&gt; 000

eg: 111&gt; (110, 101)&gt; (100)&gt; (011)&gt; (010, 001)&gt; 000

There are (**3c2\*2!**)\* 1\* 1\* (*2!*) = 12

&amp;#x200B;

Hence, 36+12=48 combinations. This can be solved because of less number of issues and alternatives. But, how to extend this to a general setting (n issues, a alternatives)? Any help is appreciated also feel free to point out if i committed any mistake above. Thanks!",0
"Productivity QuestionI work for a company that has recently significantly reduced the amount of time an employee spends on a transaction. We have data to back this up that logs how long an employee works on each transaction.  


Now we want to test to see if productivity went up. In theory, since we are spending less time on each transaction the number of transactions we do should be going up. The problem is we are severely limited by the number of leads that we get, by seasonality (the warmer seasons are much better for us than the colder seasons), and not really by how fast we can do a transaction. So when I run the numbers they do not follow that theory.  


Is there any way to ""normalize"", use a baseline, or some other solution to reduce the impact that the number of leads received has on our productivity? Thanks in advance and if any clarification is needed please let me know.

"calculating the number of cars past a point in an hour?so, I wanted to come up with a formula for the number of cars past a point if a road was completely filled to the limits of safe stopping distance. basically, number of cars through a point as a function of speed. after some though, I figured I could use some kinematics equations. one of those being:

the distance between cars would be:d= (v\^2)/2a  (I know acceleration)

&amp;#x200B;

then, I thought, based on velocity, I can figure out the total distance until a car would not make it past the point because it was too far away. which is simply velocity\*time. then, the number of cars should be distance to the farthest car dividing by the spacing of individual cars.

&amp;#x200B;

however, that comes up with N = V\*t/((V\^2)/2a)

or, ignoring the known constants, N ∝ 1/V.

&amp;#x200B;

that  is counter intuitive to me. in my mind, there should have been a sweet-spot in the middle where going any faster is detrimental due to stopping distance, and any slower would be hurt by few vehicles being able to pass in the given time. I would expect as V approaches 0, that you would not get one whole car past the mark before the time was up, thus also going to zero. instead, as V approaches zero, I get infinite cars across.

"I found this formula for calculating how to pass on payment processing fees and it works but I don't understand whyI'm embarrassed by my lack of basic mathematical skill, but nevertheless, I'm a freelancer and have to be able to understand this.

For the work I usually do, I usually just invoice the amount I'm charging and ask clients to pay in to my bank account. I have a client who for various reasons has to use a credit card to pay contractors and they suggested I setup a paypal account for this purpose so they can pay me that way.

This works fine, but paypal charges a 2.6% payment processing fee. I pass this on to the client, but I didn't realise that there's actually a flaw in how I've been doing this.

My total fee for the job was $2850. I added a 2.6% surcharge for Paypal's processing fees, and invoiced my client for $2924.1, (2850 * 1.026). This all seemed fine, but then when I received my payment, and Paypal deducted their fee I found myself left with $2847.77, not $2850. I tried to work out why I was shorted $2.23 and realised it was because the $76.33 that paypal had charged me was 2.6% of $2924.1 not, $2850 which makes sense of course, because that's how much the client paid me as per my invoice. So I realised it wasn't as simple as just charging the Amount*1.026 to get the total plus processing fees incorporated.

Again, I'm in general pretty embarrassed about my lack of mathematical ability so I found myself having to look this up on Google for an answer, not knowing how I'd calculate it myself. I found a solution, and I tested it with my latest invoice and sure enough it leaves me with exactly $2850 as it should do, except the problem is I don't understand *HOW* it works. I don't think I should just blindly use a formula I don't understand, especially not as the amount I'll be charging will differ from Amount*1.026 which to me seemed the intuitive way to calculate, so I may find myself having to explain why the amount invoiced, is what it is, and I currently wouldn't be able to.

The formula I found was

A / (100 - fee percentage)  * 100

So in my case

2850 / (100-2.6) * 100 =2926.0780287

2926.0780287 * 0.974 = 2850

"Question regarding base sets of numbers?????I’m not even sure if my question is being asked right, but I have stumbled in here on a layman’s quest to find the meaning of patterns in numbers...

I’ve realized that if you multiply any consecutive numbers by the same base10 number (0-9), and reduce the number by adding the remaining integers, you end up getting a pattern of numbers. I know it sounds kinda wonky but idk how else to explain it...

For example let’s take the base number 3

If I were to take random numbers such as 13, 14, 15, and multiply them by base 3, I would get 39, 42, and 45—reducing these integers by adding the digits to each other gets me 3, 6, and 9...

3 + 9 = 1 + 2 = 3

4 + 2 = 6

4 + 5 = 9


Adding the next consecutive numbers 46, 47, and 48 would get me another cycle of 3, 6, and 9.

Multiplying any number by a base 6 would get me consecutive combinations of 9, 6, 3...

"[Algebraic Geometry] Dimension of Sheaf FibreHi everyone, I posted a [question on MSE]( earlier this week about proving the upper semi-continuity of the rank of the fibre of a sheaf. 

I've had an answer there, but don't fully understand the proof, and understanding the use of Nakayama's Lemma here seems important. I've asked a few questions about it in the comments, but it doesn't look like the poster has been able to get back to me. If anyone could shed some light on it that would be much appreciated.

If anyone has the time also, it'd be great to get some feedback specifically on my proof (it isn't as long as it looks, I've just tried to make everything really explicit). Thanks in advance!",0

"beginning Homotopy theory questions, these are NOT HW questions, they are questions my teacher told me to think about. I think I am wrong in a lot of places.. Thank you in advance! :D 

* Define π1(X,b): what are the elements, and what is the multiplication rule.
   * π1(X,b) is a fundamental group which is an equivalance class of loops that start and end at the base point b. X is a set. I'm not sure what the multiplication rule is, I know in a group its just an operation for any two elements of the group. so is the multiplication rule the same for fundamental groups? Or does it mean like what homotopic with two ends the same? As in like, what defines a loop to be the same as another loop, or in the same equivalence class?

&amp;#x200B;

* True or false: if \[a\] and \[b\] are elements of π1(X,b) then \[a\]\[b\] = \[b\]\[a\].
   * I'm not sure about this. I learned in what groups are, which is a set with an operation that can be applied to every element in the set, and in groups they are only communitative if they are albeian, and it works for every element in the group. I'm not sure if this property works for fundamental groups, or it would only work if it is albein right? So I'm thinking False, unless it the group is albeian?  

* True of false: if X is a subset of Y then π1(X,b) is a subgroup of π1(Y,b).
   * I think this is true? I know that for Z is a sub
* True or false: if X is a subset of **R**2 then π1(X,b) is the trivial group.
   * I think this is false.. I thought the trivial group is just like the constant function? so since X is a subset of R2 doesn't necesarially mean X is R1, in which case it would be the trivial group.

"Two answers contradicting each other**Here is the question:**

If *h(x) = f(g(x))*, and if *g(x)* is even, would that mean *h(x)* will always be even?

&amp;#x200B;

**answer 1 (my answer):**

Lets say g(x) = x^(2)

Lets say f(x) = x^(3/2)

Therefore f(g(x)) = (x^(2))^(3/2)= x^(3) (because the 2's cancel out)

If h(x) = x^(3), then h(x) is not even

&amp;#x200B;

**answer 2 (book answer):**

*h(x) = f(g(x))*

*h(-x) = f(g(-x))*

*h(-x) = f(g(x))* (since *g(x) = g(-x)*)

Therefore *h(x) = h(-x)*, so its even

"Me and my friends made a game where you can battle each other .

What I want to know is what is the statically best way to win, by allocating points in the correct stats.

The system of battle is: Random number generate from the stat eg. Speed stat 7 randomly generate a number from 1 to 7


Here's how a battle plays out. 1 v 1. You generate a speed stat and so does your opponent. Whoever has the higher number goes first. Whoever had the highest attacks by generating from their attack stat. You have a choice to block which means generate from your defense stat. If you generate a higher number then the attack no health is taken away. If you generate lower than the attack its attack number - defense number then that's taken away from your Health. You also have the choice to try to evade the attack. You generate from speed. Then your opponent generates from attack precision. If attack precision is higher then speed the attack number is taken from your health. If speed is higher then no damage is taken. This continues until someone drops to 0 health 

If two people generate the same number on attack/defense no damage is taken. If two people generate the same number on speed/precision you generate again


You cannot block/evade three times in a row.  Ie after you block twice you must evade and vice versa

"Newton's Laws ConfusionWhen considering forces in an elevator moving at constant speed, by newton's first law the sum of forces must be opposite and equal (so forces up equal the forces down). However, in [this]( photo, the tension in the elevator is given as Mg + mg (where M is lift weight, and m is person's weight). By Newton's third law, surely the reaction force of the lift on the person should cancel out as they are equal. So if I name the forces as follows

Mg - weight of lift

mg - weight of man

T - tension

Rm - reaction force between the man and the lift

&amp;#x200B;

these are all the forces that are at play, right?

So surely then, Mg + mg = T + Rm, if everything is in equilibrium.

Even so, considering the forces acting on the man are just:

mg = Rm.

"Looking for the name/idea behind this Theoretical Computer Science Math problem somewhat like the Knapsack problem that can be solved with dynamic programmingAnyone know what this problem is called/commonly known as?

Imagine you have a group of k identical coins. Imagine you have a non-decreasing function value, that takes in a number ranging from 1 to k (inclusive), and outputs a number. The function is non-decreasing, so value(1) &lt;= value(2) &lt;= value(3) and so on and so forth.

How can you group your coins in such a way that their total value is as large as possible?

This is hard to explain in words so let me try to give an example. Imagine if we were doing this problem with k=8: so you have 8 coins, and you have the following value function:

* value(1) = 1

* value (2) = 5

* value(3) = 8

* value(4) = 9

* value(5) = 10

* value(6) = 17

* value(7) = 17

* value(8) = 20

Different arrangements of your 8 coins can result in a different total value. For instance, if you split your 8 coins into 1, 3 and 4, then your total value = value(1) + value(3) + value(4) = 18. If you split your coins into piles of 2 and 6, the total value = value(2) + value(6) = 23. Alternatively, if you just have one pile of 8 coins, then total value = value(8) = 20.

A valid output for this problem is a sequence of positive integers, such that the sum of those integers is equal to k.

The optimal output for this problem (what we want an algorithm to output) is the valid output that has the largest total weight.

"Terminology questionSo I've been trying to explain a graph.

Basically, I've heard the argument that goes as follows:

Assume there is a rectangle of area A on the Cartesian plane. Within that rectangle is some normally distributed data f(x). There is some function g(x) such that the integral of g(x) = A - the integral of f(x).

For the less visually adept among you, basically, what the hell do I call a function that's basically the perfect complement of the normal distribution (or any function for that matter)?

"A Little Combination and PermutationTo give context, the distance between a set of interconnected nodes is expected to be calculated.

1 nodes of {A} can yield the following results delimited by comma and return:

A

2 nodes of {AB} can yield the following results delimited by comma and return:

As you may be able to see in the pattern, the total paths of a given n set of nodes are:

5 | 30 ?

no repeating of nodes

only combinations (order does not matter, distance will be equal regardless of ordinance)

"Stokes TheoremSo, this week in Calculus 3 we learned about divergence Theorem and Stokes (Kelvin-Stokes) Theorem.  

The flux integral of a closed loop is equal to the surface integral of the curl of the vector field of any region bounded by that loop.  

the divergence theorem which stated that the flux through any surface is equal to the integral of the divergence through the enclosed volume. 

&amp;#x200B;

for stokes theorem, we were able to pick any surface that was bounded by that region.  If it was a circle, we could have used a cone, the disk, a hemisphere etc.  I am confused on if or how you could pick any volume bounded by the surface.  Is it some higher dimensional interaction that we cannot see, but still possible?

&amp;#x200B;

I am an EE major and understand the use of the divergence theorem for calculating a charge, and using an arbitrary surface, but that is only because that charge is the source of the entire field.  is there some way of doing a similar arbitrary volume/surface for generic divergence theorem problems?

"Checking my proof for Metric Spaces: Fix a point x0 element of X. Prove that the function f: X -&gt; R given by f(x) = d(x, x0) is continuousSo the definition of continuous for metric spaces, is a function is continuous if a sequence xn converges to x, then f(xn) converges to f(x).

&amp;#x200B;

So Let x0 be an element of X. Let xn be a sequence that converges to x0. Then f(xn) = d(xn, x0). As the sequence continuous, f(xn) gets closer and closer to 0, since xn is a sequence that converges to x0. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Xn converges to x, means that for all e &gt; 0, the exists a number N, s.t. for all n &gt; N, d(xn, x) &lt; e.

&amp;#x200B;

And also f(xn) converges to 0, and so for all e &gt; 0, there exists a number N, s.t. for all n &gt; N, d(xn, x), treated as an element of the function f, converges to d(x0, x0) = 0, and so we find that d(f(xn), f(x) &lt; e.

So then the lim (xn, x0) = 0 and then lim ( f(xn), f(x0) ) = 0. Therefore, the function is continuous",0

"Advanced NPV QuestionSo a basic NPV is simply the sum of {c / (1+i)\^n} for each period of income in a cash flow. You can use Excel's IRR and NPV functions to calculate these properly. Once you have the period rate {i} you do not need the NPV function per say to get to the next NPV. You can simply take your initial Cost, minus the principal on the next cash flow period, plus (Initial cost \* periodic rate - interest on the next cash flow period) to derive at the next NPV. This is called an NPV roll forward.

&amp;#x200B;

The above holds true in most simple scenarios, however my issue is that i do not have an equal first period of cash flow as its shorter. To accommodate this i need to adjust the present value formula above so that it is {C / (1+i)\^(1-n+w)}, w = number of days between settle date and next coupon date / number of days within the period. Essentially it is saying the first period is not a full period, there for needs to be &lt;&gt; 1 but .5 or whatever w works out to be. At this point I can determine all the NPVs for each period using the adjusted formula and everything checks out. However, I can no longer do the NPV roll forward approach as it doesn't get me 100% to the next NPV. I feel like i need to adjust the NPV roll forward formula to accommodate this w that was introduced into the present value formula above. Not sure if it needs to be where the {initial cost \* periodic rate...then there is some math formula added... - interest on the next cash flow}.",0

"Can you make a simple equation to eliminate artifactually large differences from a sample that contains ""circular"" numbering? Explanation in comments.Hi everyone,

I'll try to keep this short. I have a sample where numbers range from 0 to 179. 0=180=360 and 90=270. 

These numbers represent the axis of astigmatism of corneas. Since astigmatism usually is ""regular,"" or of equal magnitude 180 degrees apart, we only measure from 0 to 179.


However, because the axis of astigmatism is something measured in degrees, the numbers at the end are actually very close to the numbers at the beginning (since it comes full circle). Aka, 179 could also be considered to be -1, 175 could be -5, etc.


Let's say I want to take the difference between two measurements: 52 and 50 - easy, the difference is 2. But if I want to take the difference between 179 and 1, the difference should be -2 instead of 178.

Obviously, I could get the answer by subtracting 180 from 179 (as above) so that the numbers are closer to the starting point of 0, but I figured we could create an equation that would work with any numbers.

The problem only happens when comparing numbers at the beginning and end of the circle. 

The question is: **is there some way to make a simple equation so that if anybody looked at the measurements and used the equation, that they could easily find the true difference between the numbers?** I was trying to play around with absolute values but couldn't get it to work out perfectly for all numbers.

"Card game stats questionThis is probably an easy one for you. I have a question about the statistics surrounding the new mulligan rule in Magic the Gathering card game, specifically as it relates to drawing a specific card in a multiplayer game. The new mulligan rule is shown below.

&gt;*To take a mulligan, a player shuffles their 7 starting cards in their hand back into their deck, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size (7), then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their deck in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player's opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards.*

In multiplayer games, you get 1 free mulligan, (so no putting cards back from your hand until after the second mulligan)

My question is about the card ""Serum Powder"". Which says:

&gt;""Any time you could mulligan and Serum Powder is in your hand, you may exile all the cards from your hand *(remove the cards from the deck permanently)*, then draw that many cards. You can do this in addition to taking mulligans.

So basically you could reset the cards discarded down to zero again. 

So my question is, in a 99 card deck, where there is only a single copy of Serum Powder, what are the chances of drawing the card on the way to Mulligan-ing to zero? Is it 56%?",0

"Can someone calculate some odds of working with 5 people names Chris Paul Smith?According to [How Many of Me]( which pulls it's data from the US census, there are approximately 15,064 Christopher Smiths in the US.

So if ~15,000 Chris Smiths are alive in the US, what are the chances that a workplace would have 5 of them.

"Is it possible to prove that the Riemann Hypothesis is undecidable?I am not sure if this will be intelligible; if not, please do not hesitate to ask a clarifying question.

&amp;#x200B;

So there is [this]( Numberphile video were a guy talks about the Gödel incompleteness theorem. He then goes on about undecidability in general and mentions that a strange way of proving RH would be to show that it is undecidable within our system of axioms. Because if it is, it means that we won't find a counterexample to RH since in doing so the problem would become decidable, so there are no counterexamples and so RH holds. Without being sure that this is the correct terminology, I use the word ""undecidable"" to qualify any statement that can't be proven right nor wrong in a given axiomatic system.

&amp;#x200B;

So essentially: ""if I prove that RH is undecidable, then it is decidable, because I then know it's true"". This makes me conclude that you can't prove that RH is undecidable, because otherwise you end up contradicting yourself. So there is my problem. Either this trick of proving RH the guy mentions is essentially useless, or I am confused.

&amp;#x200B;

One way that I get this wrong could be that I mix up the instances when we confine ourselves to our axiomatic system (lets call it S) and the instances when we go outside to ""look in"". Because it could be that the proof of RH undecidability in S is made outside of S. Lets look closely at the steps of my reasoning to see what I mean (brackets for clarity):

1. Assume that we can prove that \[RH is undecidable in S\] in S
2. Then we have proof in S that we cannot disprove RH in S
3. Then we have proof in S that there is no counter example to RH in S
4. Then we have proven RH in S
5. Then RH is decidable in S
6. In total, if we can prove that \[RH is undecidable in S\] in S, then RH is decidable in S
7. Thus we can't prove that RH is undecidable in S

This reasoning seems robust, but the guy was maybe referring to a proof that \[RH is undecidable in S\] that is made outside of S, perhaps in a system S' that is stronger than S, in which case the above reasoning doesn't apply (§1 doesn't hold). But that would raise more questions: What would S' look like? At what point would we regard S' as elementary enough as to be convinced by the proof? Or maybe my reasoning fails elsewhere?

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have is ""Is it possible to prove that the Riemann Hypothesis is undecidable?""; if yes where does my reasoning fail? If it fails in §1 the way I considered just above, then what about S'?

"Tricky question found in an old informatics olympiad for high schoolersA sequence of positive integers, a[1], a[2], a[3], . . . , a[n] is called a Special Sequence,

all the elements are distinct. For example, (2, 4, 8, 32) is a Special Sequence. But
(4, 2, 8) is not, because 4 does not divide 2. Similarly (2, 4, 4, 8) is also not Special,
because the elements are not distinct.

"Does there exist a function that does this?Hello, I know almost nothing about math, so please forgive me if this question is really stupid. 

Background: Recently I was playing a video game and wondered if it would be possible to quantify a player’s skill at the game, based on how likely they are to win against another player. So, for example, if player 1 has a 50% chance of winning against player 2, their skill would be equal, because they are evenly matched. I then arbitrarily determined that I have a skill of 1. 
Based on common sense, the following should be true:

- if someone has a 50% chance of winning against me, his skill = my skill = 1.

- if someone has a 100% chance of winning against me, that’s impossible. Unless that person is infinitely skilled there should be at least a chance that I’ll win.

- if someone has a 0% chance of winning against me, that’s also impossible. Unless he has a skill of 0 there should be at least a chance that he’ll win.

That is about where my brain gave up. So, would it be possible to write a mathematical function that calculates a number for skill, given these assumptions? Or were any of my assumptions wrong?

"Two functions equivalent if they have equal values on an interval?This was a shower thought, but unfortunately I've been out of school for too long and my analysis skills are way too rusty for me to prove this one myself. Curious if this is true:

Let's say you have two real-valued, polynomial, continuous functions F and G. (Keep them well-behaved!)

You also have some interval [a, b], with a &lt;&gt; b, such that for all numbers X in the interval, F(X) = G(X). In other words, there's a  interval over which the two functions have equal values, and that interval doesn't consist of a single point.

Does this necessarily mean F and G are the same function?

It seems so, to me: having the same values over the interval means that their ""shape"" is the same. This suggests the derivatives (and all higher order derivatives) are the same as well, if you consider the derivatives as a description of the slope/curve behavior of the function. (I don't know this is true for sure, but it *seems* true.)

If that's true, then call Y the ""first number just outside [a, b]"" which I am well aware is not a real thing -- take the limit as Y approaches b from the right, etc. Intuitively, if the shape of the curve over [a, b] is identical for each function, then the value just outside the interval should also be identical because the behavior of the functions as they ""exit the interval"" are the same. Which means you can expand the interval to [a, Y] with Y &gt; b and still maintain the truth of the statement about the interval.

The same logic should apply with Z approaching a from the left. Accordingly, you can expand the interval to all reals, and therefore the two functions are equivalent because they have the same values over the entire set of real numbers.

This obviously breaks down if you have non-continuous functions or if your interval is only a single number. But if you keep to nice, well-behaved polynomial functions with a an arbitrarily large interval, this seems right.

"Combinations/Permutations confusionI've come across a problem and I don't understand why the solution involves combinations rather than permutations.

---

You have a very large number of red and blue coins in a container such that the probabilities of picking them are:

R = 3/4
B = 1/4

You take 10 coins out and put them into a box. What is the chance that your box has exactly 4 red coins? 

---

The way I'm thinking about it is kind of imagining the tree diagram. Follow one branch of it where you get 4 red coins and then 6 blue coins the probability would be 

(1/4)^6 * (3/4)^4

For that particular branch. Now that branch is just one of many ways of getting 4 red coins and so you have to multiply the probability by the number of ways you can get 4 red coins. I thought that for this you should use permutations since that probability is found by considering just one **order** of steps to get the desired outcome of 4 red, or one path down the tree. The actual answer is to use the combinations.

I think I've majorly confused myself here. I can accept that the number of combinations is the number of ways of getting r objects from a set of n. But for this I'm imagining ABCD and getting AB, AC, AD, DC, DB, CB. I don't see how it comes into this problem.",0

But I don't understand what my teacher means and what the question means when it says ""Interpret the physical significance of f'(p) = definite integral of f(x) from 0 to p"". Is there some relationship here I'm not understanding?

"Please help me or tell me I'm wrongWhen describing test results in the clinical lab I work for, we are asked to use sentences like the following:

""A positive test result was found in 40% of the cells studied. Of these, 30% had the typical abnormal pattern and 10% had a variant abnormal pattern.""

These are the results we are describing;

     60 negative (or normal) cells

     30 positive cells w/typical pattern

     10 positive cells w/atypical pattern

   100 total cells

When I read the above description of these results, I think ""what about the rest of the positive cells?"" To me, it sounds like we are only describing 40% of the positive cells. Once the phrase ""of these"" is used, the rest of the sentence is referring only the positive cells, right?

If it were up to me, the sentence would read ""A positive test result was found in 40% of the cells studied. Of these, 75% had the typical abnormal pattern and 25% had a variant abnormal pattern.""

"Why is this a thing?
Today I was watching a video about 'life path numbers' in numerology. I found out something very interesting. I know nothing about math,so sorry if the question is stupid!

Take a random date:
Example 18.10.1995

Add 18+10+1995 
You get: 2023
Add the numbers like this: 2+0+2+3 
It equals 7

If you add the numbers like this:
1+8+1+0+1+9+9+5 
equals 34 and 3+4 is also 7

The second example is the proper way to calculate your 'life path number' according to the video(add up the numbers from your birth date until you get a single digit number) The first example is how I calculated it before watching the video.

I found it interesting,so I tried it with other dates and I always got the same numbers in the end. Can you,math people excuse my broken English and explain why is this happening??",0
"Can someone help me understand something I just read about how multiplying random variables?EDIT: Turns out I should have just kept reading the textbook instead of spending hours searching for more info. They only mentioned it in a single sentence at the start of the chapter, but had a whole section explaining it in more detail that made it click for me at the end. They even had the formula I was looking for for an unbiased estimate of long term annualised returns based on horizon in the final subsection, [seen here]( reading a textbook that's talking about time-series stock price data and average returns. It talks about the difference between arithmetic average return and geometric average return. One of the things it says is that if you have a number of years of i.i.d. random returns you can predict the expected return for the next year as the arithmetic average of the historical returns. For example, if you have:

2015: r = 6%

2016: r = 7%

2017: r = 5%

2018: r = 6%

then, assuming that all years are i.i.d, the expected return in 2014 would be 6% (the average of all those years). This makes sense, since they're all taken from the same distribution, so it's like looking at previous rolls of a die to determine the average value obtained when rolling that die.

But then it talks about how the expected EAR over a multiple-year period is not the same as the expected return for a single period. So even if you expect to earn 6% return on average every year from 2019 to 2022, you don't expect to earn:

    1.06^4 - 1 = 26.2%

over that four year period. Instead the expected EAR would be slightly less (something like 5.8% per year), so that the expected four year return would be:

    1.058^4 - 1 = 25.3%

The rationale is that because each year's return is a random variable, and multiple positive variances have a greater effect than multiple negative variances, the arithmetic mean is biased when used over multiple years.

I tested this in excel using randomly generated data from a normal distribution and can see that it's true. Generating 10,000 random returns for three years with a mean return of 6.5% I can see that the average EAR over a two year period is around 6.3-6.4% and the average EAR over a three year period is around 6.25-6.35%.

I'd love to read more about specifically why this happens, because in my textbook it was only given as a footnote. Their rationale doesn't seem to make sense to me because if positive variances had a bigger effect than negative variances wouldn't you expect the EAR to be *larger* than the arithmetic mean? Like by my intuition I'm imagining an example where you expected 6.5% return every year, but some years you got 7% and some years you get 6%. If you get 6.5% two years in a row as expected then you get 13.4% return. If you get 7% two years in a row by variance then you get a 14.5% return: a gain of 1.068%. If you get 6% two years in a row by variance then you get 12.4%, a loss of only 1.063%. So you would gain *more* on average over two years than you'd expect if it was a static 6.5% p.a., not less.

The other thing I'd like to be able to do is work out what the expected return actually is for an n-year period given the expected yearly return. All I know now is that it's less than the expected yearly return itself, but not by how much. I expect the 'how much' is calculated using the variance of the random variable, and it'd be great to see exactly how that works out.",0

"Problem: Price cut and more customers still results in revenue lossI'm working on an article in response to a piece that advocates for cutting the fares of the commuter train, as this would increase ridership by 33%. I'm arguing that this would still make for a loss in ticket revenue. Could you please check my math to see if I did all of this correctly?

&amp;#x200B;

Train fair is currently $4.25.

&amp;#x200B;

Advocates are pushing for that to be cut down to $2.50, which (they suggest) would increase ridership by %33.

&amp;#x200B;

I argue that the increase in ridership (33%) does not make up for the $1.75 (41%) cut, and would make for a 22% loss in revenue. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if 100 people ride at 4.25, the train collects $425. If 133 people ride the train at 2.50, the train collects $332.50.

"Probabilit - Family Card Game/Number of DecksI have been thinking about this from time to time, but I have had no earthly idea how to go about figuring it out. I don't know why it took me so long to think to ask the Reddit community that specializes in this!

Our family regularly plays Shanghai Rummy, a matching game played with multiple standard card decks.

My Grandma has always said that the number of decks used = number of players + 1. We generally have 4-8 players and for time/ease, we have always used the same cards/number of decks for every game, regardless of number of players. No one is 100% sure how many decks are in there, but it's either 5 or 6. 

Recently, 3 of us were out of town and wanted to play, so we looked up the rules. The rules state for 3-4 players, use 2 decks and for 5 or more players, use 3 decks. 

Would decreasing the number of decks impact playing time?

I wasn't sure how, or if, using fewer decks would change the length of time it generally takes to obtain matching cards each round.

I have two different scales. The first ranges from 0 to 2000, while the second ranges from 0 to 2400.

How can I create a standardised scale for both of them?

"Odds of being in X car crashes vs being in 1 shark attack.The odds of being in a a car crash in the US are 1 in 572. 

The odds of being in a shark attack in the US are 1 in 11.5 million.

&amp;#x200B;

To me this seems like a huge gap, so I was curious how many car crashes you'd have to get in to be on par with getting in a shark attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

572\^x=11.5m ; turns out the answer is about 2? So you are just as likely to get into two car crashes as you are get in one shark attack? That doesn't seem right, I know scores of people who have been in two car crashes but nobody in a shark attack, and I would imagine that's true of almost everyone reading this post. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I doing something wrong? Is log(11.5m)/log(572) not the correct way to solve this? Or am I misunderstanding the stats here, perhaps they are only on any given day where you do both activities? Obviously people drive much more often than they go to the beach, if so then is this right and using log ratio is the proper way to solve this? Thanks!

"Solving Collisions using VectorsHi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to calculate the speed of a moving sphere after it collides with a stationary sphere. Collision will be ellastic and the stationary sphere will remain stationary. I can solve it analytically using lines and all but I'm trying to implement this on an FPGA and the code will be written in Verilog. So I'm stuck with Integer maths and I can't use trigonometric functions and square root. In addition, I have a little time window to make the calculation so long calculations are problematic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a solution that gives correct answers but it's a long and complex equation to synthesize as a circuit, so I need a simpler approach, that only uses addition and subtraction if possible. Neither nor my friends came up with solution unfortunately. Tha ball will be drawn on a screen.

&amp;#x200B;

Known variables: 

* Center of stationary ball
* Center of moving ball at the instant of collision
* Point of collision
* Speed vector of moving ball:

1. For this vector we have two variables. First one is the amount of movement in the given direction in terms of Pixels. Second one is the amount of clock cycles that needs to pass before the ball moves and is redrawn on the screen. 
2. Amount of movement is constant, that is, ball moves by 1 pixel in each direction when it's redrawn. To change the speed, instead of redrawing the ball after 500000 cycles, we redraw the ball after 400000 cycles so it seemslike it sped up and vice versa.
3. Given above information, we can define the speed of the ball as: v\_x=1/c\_x and v\_y=1/c\_y where c is the amount of clock cycles required before the ball is redrawn.
4. One final note: You can ignor 1, 2, 3 if you don't understand and use a single vector v=(vx,vy). I can make the corrections hopefully.

P.S. What I'm looking for is to find the speed vector after collision, using only vector addition and subtraction if possible but of course all solutions are helpful and welcome. Thanks in advance for reading this long post/question.",0

"Stock/Dividend Payout FormulaI thought I’d be able to figure this out using a modified version of a compounding interest formula, but i flubbed something so I thought I’d bring it to you guys.

I’m trying to determine a calculation for the value of my investment into a certain dividend paying stock for the next few years. I know this can’t be measured exactly because stock prices and dividend payouts change every day/month, so I’d like to just go with the assumptions that the dividend and stock prices will just stay the same for every period. The assumptions I’d like to make are that the stock price is $8.45, the dividend payout for each stock is $.085, dividends are payed out monthly, I’m starting with 100 shares of stock, all of my dividends each month get reinvested to more shares of this stock, and I’m not adding any additional stock other than what I’m making back in dividend reinvestment. What will the value of my initial invest be in the next 5 years? What’s the equation to calculate that? And what would that equation look like if we could add in a variable to measure any extra investment? (Lets say another 25 shares of stock once a month for that period of 5 years).

"Trying to come up with a formula to calculate corrected differential pressure based on rate of flow.I work at an Airport. I perform quality control checks on fueling equipment, one of which is a daily differential pressure (DP) check. (PSI before filtration / PSI after filtration) According to our guidelines, we must record observed DP, and we must also record *corrected* DP. 

Corrected DP in this case represents what the DP would be at the maximum rated flow of the refueling unit. The maximum DP allowed at 100% flow is 15 psi. Basically, we have to calculate the corrected DP to determine whether the DP would be above or below 15 psi if the unit were at max flow. I've asked for years what the formula was and nobody has been able to tell me. Thus far, we've had to use a computer program that figures it out for us, and I'm tired of not totally understanding how it works. Here is the info I know. 

We have something called a curve chart which shows the graph of the Max DP at your observed flow rate. The line representing max DP is curved, hence the name, which also means it is an exponential function, because the differential pressure increases exponentially with flow rate. 

Max DP at 100% flow is 15 psi. Max DP at 50% is 6.5 psi. We'll say that flow rate (%) is x, and DP is y. Basically, the line on the graph begins at (0,0) and ends at (100,15) while passing through (50, 6.5,) and I have no idea how they came up with this graph.

Here is an actual example from April 30, 2019. A refueling unit with a max flow rate of 450 gpm (100%,) observed flow rate of 210 gpm (46.66...%,) and an observed DP of 2 psi, the corrected DP was 5 psi. 

It may as well be magic, apparently, because nobody can prove to me on paper how they came up with 5 psi. I'm about 13 yrs removed from any sort of advanced math, so I'm a bit rusty to say the least. I don't remember the last time I felt this dumb while trying to figure something out.

"What numbers are feasibility constructible?After a course in abstract algebra at university, we ended with a fun little topic: Ruler and Compass constructions. We showed with the algebra we had learned, that the constructible numbers are a field, closed under square roots.

Recently after I was chatting to my uncle, who in constructing his barn, uses a 3,4,5 (meter) Pythagorean triangle to give almost perfect right angles.

My question, is what numbers are “feasibly” constructible in this way? By this I mean say I give you a unit length and designate a circle of radius n, in R^2 in which you may construct numbers, with only a ruler and compass. (By this I mean, for example “adding” two numbers together by drawing one line segment directly after another)

Clearly, no number greater than 2n can be constructed, as this would definitely not lie within the circle, but there seems no lower bound (if n&gt;2) as we can have 1+1, followed by 1/2, ... , (1/2)^m (as we can happily perform multiplication and division within the circle).

"Gentleman Jack Currency QuestionHi Everyone! I am new to reddit and this is my first post.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context:**

I have recently been watching the HBO television show Gentleman Jack and have been loving it. I live in Canada, so there are already five episodes out and no spoilers but I have a currency question related to the show. The show is set in 1832 and the protagonist offers to sell her coal pits to a buyer. The price per acre that she offers is 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies). As the inflation rates have significantly changed from then, I was wondering how much this would be in today's currency for context when the characters are talking about prices on the show. I did some calculations last night and was wondering if the method needs to be better and if the answer I received is reasonable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem and solution that I found:**

According to Wikipedia, before 1971, British pounds were divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence, which makes 240 pence (rather than the current division of 100 pence today) per pound. So with the price at 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies) per acre, assuming that each pound is 240 pence (as its set in 1832), amount in pounds = 226\*240 = 54 240 pence, amount in shillings = 17\*12 = 204 pence and then there is 6 pence. The total is = 54 240 + 204 + 6 = 54 450 pence.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this U.K. inflation calculator [ I divided 54 450/240 to get the amount in pounds it would be which is 226.875 (as it is unclear to me if this calculator accounts for the 240 pence in a pound pre-1971 issue). Inserting this number into this calculator with the start year at 1832 and the end year at 2019, it's £25,190.91 per acre in today's currency. By using Google's currency calculator, that would be $42, 854.78 Canadian Dollars per acre or $31,883.88 U.S. dollars per acre.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a reasonable answer? Are there any adjustments that must be made to the calculations? Is there a different approach I should have taken to the problem? Please let me know!

"Solve for Y.Given a government tax rate (X), how many hours of overtime per week at 1.5 times hourly rate would it take to break even after taxes? (Assume that overtime is after 40 hours)

If I pay for the benefits as a deduction on my paycheck and my yearly salary is bumped up AN EXACTLY equal amount, there will come a certain number of hours (Y) worked per week at which I recieved the benefit tax free. 

To clarify, the benefit is free with 40 hours worked per week, just pay the tax on the benefit come tax time.

The point of this equation is to figure out how many hours of overtime are required for the taxes to pay for themselves.



Example: 
$20 an hour prior wage.
$1000 in health benefits given as a $0.50 raise (50 working weeks, 40 hours a week = salary based on 2000 hours)

New wage: $20.50
New healthcare benefit: $1000
Tax rate = X


***Above edited for clarity, Below added as a solution. Feel free to check my work.

X = tax rate
Y = Overtime hours needed per week for the ""benefits raise"" to ALSO pay for it's own taxes.

Y = (((1÷(1-X))×40)−40)÷1.5

"Can Someone Help Me Solve This Problem? 

I am putting a bid together for a public works construction project and the agency has a limitation on the amount of money that can be charged for the mobilization bid item. There are a total of 27 bid items. It states that the amount that can be bid for mobilization is maxed out at 5% of the amount bid for all bid items not including the mobilization item itself. They do this so contractors can't load their bid up with mobilization money and get paid for work prior to the work being done. I want to put exactly 5% of the sum of all items not including the mobilization item in the bid.

"Rules for generalized tensor algebra and calculusI'm attaching at the bottom an example of a derivation for momentum continuity to illustrate what I'm talking about.  It seems like eventually you get to a point in the multivariable algebra and calculus where the rules and notation are less standardized.  I feel like I'm missing a standard set of rules for how to deal with keeping track of tensor order and rank, and things like when are some operations commutative/distributive or not.  Frequently I find myself having to scour wikipedia for obscure rules and identities that I've never heard of or seen before.  For example, today in this derivation I needed to look up what a dyad was (the multiplication of u\_vec with itself as an outer product) and how to take a divergence of a dyad.  I get the vague impression that inner products reduce the order of the tensor product and outer products increase the order of the tensor product, but I'm not entirely sure about how this stuff generalizes.  I'm also starting to work with optimization problems and needing to get way more familiar with generalized multivariable operations that map vector spaces to vector spaces, and generalized derivatives and gradients where you specify what you are taking it with respect to.

&amp;#x200B;

My general question is, ""Is there a good resource that covers generalized rules for multivariable algebra/calculus that handles tensor stuff in a standardized way?""

"N people, how many ways are there to choose a committee of n peopleTwo students are given the following problem: From N people, how many ways are there to choose a committee of n people, with one person chosen as the president? One student gives $n\\binom{N}{n}$, while the other student gives an answer of $N\\binom{N-1}{n-1}$.

By writing out the binomial coefficients, show that the two answers are equal.     

The binomial coefficient states that $\\binom{N}{k} = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}$.

Thus in the first students case: $n\\binom{N}{n} = \\frac{nN!}{n!(N-n)!} = \\frac{N!}{(n-1)!(N-n)!}$.

 In the second students case: $N\\binom{N-1}{n-1} = \\frac{N(N-1)!}{(n-1)!\[(N-1)-(n-1)\]!}$

which can be simplified to $\\frac{N!}{(n-1)!\[(N-1)-(n-1)\]!}$.

If we set the two equal to eachother we get: $\\frac{N!}{(n-1)!(N-n)!} = \\frac{N!}{(n-1)!\[(N-1)-(n-1)\]!}$

"Equation/Theory for sorting people into groups and reshuffling them into groups with unique people 

Hello all!

I am trying to generate randomized teams with a caveat that each sorting will maximize the number of new people together on a team. This is for a school orientation where we are trying to get people to meet as many new people as possible

Background info: This is for setting up groups for multiple activities in a day. We will have 1 activity where we divide all the people into teams for the event. For the next activity, we want to divide people (same group as in the first activity) into different teams (of a different number of people per team from the first activity) but maximize the number of new exposures so that people are on teams with new people. Then do it again for a third set.

Current thoughts: I was thinking of assigning random values to the groups each time then just sorting by number and making teams this way, but that does not guarantee any level of maximal exposure. The maximal exposure part is what I currently struggle with. I am able to get two unique groups simply with excel but cannot figure out how to make the third group unique.

This was my thinking:

The number of ways to arrange the answers randomly is 4^(100) because each question has 4 different possibilities.

Say you put the sequence ABCD on the first place. Then you randomly put all the remaining answers down. This has 4^(96) possibilities. But then, the sequence ABCD can go in any of 97 places, so the probability should be:

97\*4^(96)/4^(100)=97/256.

But this falls apart if the test has 259 or more questions because then the probability will be 256\*4^(255)/4^(259)=256/256=1 or greater. But there are obviously still ways that the sequence never appears like (A,A,A,A,A...).

"What kind of ""rating system"" is this?Not sure if askmath is the best place for this but I don't know where would be, if anybody knows point me in the right direction.

I'm curious what you would call a 1 to 10 rating system where 1 is your least favorite and ten is your favorite *within the parameters of a set of options where you have to have one of each.*

For example let's say i use this system to rate the sports Baseball, Basketball, Hockey, and Football. 

I really like all of these sports and they're my 4 favorite sports in the world, but out of these options baseball is my favorite and basketball is my least. So with this system I would rate Baseball as 10, and Basketball as 1, then place hockey and football within based on how they would scale to those, let's say 7 for hockey and 6 for football.

This rating system shows that i like baseball, hockey, and football a lot more than I like Basketball, but I still like basketball. I'm not rating it a 1 out of 10 sport, i'm rating hockey and football based on how they fit between my favorite and least favorite.

I hope I explained that right, kind of hard to describe what i'm looking for.",0

"Why don't we extend algebra to deal with division by zero and infinity?Would this be useful? It seems like the contradictions you run into come from trying to reduce e.g. x / 0  when maybe you just shouldn't. Why don't we just use rules like this with real numbers, zero type numbers, and infinity type numbers?

1 / inf = 0 = zero(1)

0 / inf = 0\^2 = zero\^2(1)

1 \* inf = inf(1)

1 / inf = 0 \* 1 = zero(1)

0 / 0 = 1

0 \* inf = 1

x \* 0 = zero(x)

x / 0 = inf(x)

x / inf = zero(x)

x \* inf = inf(x)

0 / x = 1 / inf(x) = inf\^-1(1 / x) = zero(1 / x)

zero(x) = 1 / inf(x) = inf\^-1(x)

&amp;#x200B;

zero(x) \* zero(y) = zero\^2(xy) = xy / inf\^2

zero(x) / zero(y) = x / y

inf(x) \* inf(y) = xy / zero\^2 = inf\^2(xy)

inf(x) / inf(y) = x / y

zero(x) / inf(y) = zero\^2(x / y) = (x / y) / inf\^2

"Difference between algebra and arithmeticSo I'm in a reddit disagreement with someone who is claiming that every logical calculation in every day life is algebra.

My argument against this was (my verbatim comments is in italics)

*Define ""Algebra"" on google gives this ""the part of mathematics in which letters and other general symbols are used to represent numbers and quantities in formulae and equations.""*

*Wikipedia gives this ""In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols""*

*So far every source I've come across states that algebra is the solving of problems via symbolism and manipulating symbolism. Most also go further to say that most word problems can be solved arithmetically or with algebra. What you seem to be saying here is that applying any form of calculations in real life is algebra?*

This is not the complete back and forth but I also gave two examples to ask for clarification on the difference between algebra and arithmetic.

&gt;*So $100 for 10kg = $10/kg is algebra and 100 divide by 10 = 10 is arithmetic?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, 100/10=10 is arithmetic. Having $100 and 10 kg and solving for X number of dollars per kg and knowing HOW to set up the arithmetic to solve for X is algebra.  
&gt;  
&gt;*20mg of mg of protein in 60ml of urine is 20/60. Isn't that the entire equation?*  
&gt;  
&gt;No. 20mg/60mL=0.33mg/mL is the whole equation. And again, 20mg/60mL = X mg/mL, solve for X is what you’re doing really quickly with basic math, but setting up that equation and solving for the unknown is algebra. Someone could say the answer is 60/20=3, and their arithmetic is right (because 60 divided by 20 does equal 3), but their algebra is wrong because they solved for the wrong thing (X mL per mg instead of X mg per mL)

Lastly, I also stated that ratios and fractions can be taught and understood without algebra and that there are both algebraic and arithmetic fractions which means that they are quite different forms of math beyond algebra just giving units or meanings to simple arithmetic.

This is the entire comment chain for transparency.   [ was getting massively downvoted with only the initial commentor explaining to me why I could be wrong. I don't care about the downvotes. I'd just like some clarification on this topic to make sure my understanding of algebra, arithmetic and number-logic is correct.",0

    A1: ""Alaskan survives through 2009""
    A2: ""Missourian survives through 2009""
    A3: ""Vermontese survives through 2009""

    E = (A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3^C) ∪ (A1 ∩ A2^C ∩ A3) ∪ (A1^C ∩ A2 ∩ A3)

I am really confused at this part. First of all, I don't understand how it is possible to find anything in common between two events and the complement of the other, since the complement is the event that the opposite happens.

How can does (A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3^C) share anything in common with each other? I can see what A1 and A2 have in common with each other, and that is that their subjects survived, but it is an intersection of all three, so how can they have an intersection if they don't all have something in common?

**Question 1** \- A grocery store stocks 1-gallon cartons of skim milk, 1% milk, 2% milk, and whole milk. A customer is asked to buy 10 gallons of milk. The customer needs to buy at least one carton of each type of milk.

How many different ways can the kinds of milk to buy be selected?

&amp;#x200B;

A: 120

B: 84

C: 210

D: 286

&amp;#x200B;

There are 4 different types of milk. We must acquire 10 in total with at least 1 of each type. Once the 4 are chosen, then we have 6 remaining gallons to acquire. Doesn't the question essentially ask what are the different ways we can choose the remaining 6 gallons from the 4 different types?

In that case, since there are 4 different options for each gallon and 6 gallons to be chosen without regard to arrangement, wouldn't that give us 4\^6/6? (Obviously incorrect because it is too large)

**Question 2** \- A random experiment consists of tossing a fair 6-sided die repeatedly.

How many tosses are required to be certain that the probability that at least one '6' appears is greater than or equal to 1/2?

A: 3

B: 5

C: 6

D: 4

&amp;#x200B;

A single toss of a fair die would give us a probability of 1/6 to get a 6. If we toss it 3 times, we would get 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 chance to get a 6 so that answer is A. Is this correct?

**Question 3** \- N is an integer between 0 and 9.

For how many values of N does \[123,3N2\] = \[0\] mod 8, where 123,3N2 is a six-digit number?

A: 2

B: 5

C: 4

D: 3

&amp;#x200B;

Are we suppose divide all variations of 123,3N2 by 8 and see if there are any remainders to determine the number of times 8 evenly divides 123,3N2? In that case, 8 evenly divides the different variations of 123,3N2 4 times so the answer is C, correct?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, why are there square brackets around those numbers - I've never seen them in my reading material but for some reason they show up on the sample test?

Given that (M\^2) = 51 (mod 59), what is (M\^12) (mod 59)?

&amp;#x200B;

A: 7

B: 36

C: 3

D: 30

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some kind of mistake? They assign N in the beginning but then the problem is in terms of M. Anyway, I am quite lost on what to do here. I would appreciate help. How can I tie this information together to get the answer?

**Question 5** \- Given the characteristic equation: x\^(n + 1) = 2x\^(n - 1), what is it when expressed as a explicit function?  


A: 2 + 2\^n

B: 3 + n x 2\^n

C: 3 + n x 2\^(n + 1)

D: 1 + 2\^(n + 1)

&amp;#x200B;

When I divide the equation by x\^(n - 1), I get x\^2 = 2. If I subtract 2 to both sides, I get (x\^2) -2. At this point, I would usually factor the polynomials to get the value of x but I'm not sure how to do so cleanly so I'm stuck here.

"Reasoning behind the probability in a random dice systemI'm curious as to *why* a random dice system I analyzed is showing the results it did.

To put a long story short, I analyzed the probabilities involved in a random dice system that another group created, suspicious that their system wasn't actually evenly balanced between two choices (which is what they try to maintain).

----------------------------------------

Here are the rules:

1) Two players choose a ""threshold"" with a range of 100, limited between 0 and 999. For example, player one chooses a threshold of 0-100, while player 2 chooses a threshold of 600-700.

2) Each player rolls a 999-sided die, and compares the results.

3) The higher roll wins, except when the roll falls within their threshold.

3a. - A roll within the player's threshold will win over a roll outside a threshold, no matter what. For example, player one with a threshold of 0-100 rolls a 50, while player 2 with a threshold of 600-700 rolls an 800. Player one wins, for being in their threshold.

3b. - If both players roll inside their threshold, the higher number wins.

----------------------------------------

I ran a simulation of each threshold playing against each other threshold 100,000 times, and these were the results:

Threshold of 0-100 secured victory against:
...
Average win rate = 53601 

Threshold of 100-200 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 52790.1 

Threshold of 200-300 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 52006.2 

Threshold of 300-400 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 51196 

Threshold of 400-500 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 50356.5 

Threshold of 500-600 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 49563.8 

Threshold of 600-700 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 48740.4 

Threshold of 700-800 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 47984.5 

Threshold of 800-900 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 47120 

Threshold of 900-999 secured victory against: 
...
Average win rate = 46379.3 

The tendency for lower thresholds to win is evident, and stays true no matter how many times I run the simulation.

My question is... why? What's the reason behind this discrepancy? I feel as though I have a vague understanding, but I can't quite cement it, or put it into words. Can anyone help me to better understand this?",0

"Why do my units not seem to match right?So I'm changing some legacy C++ software to go from unitless to having units.  (We seem to have unit mistakes too often for my taste).  In C++, I am able to override operators so that I can make whatever classes I want implement operators like +, -, \*, / etc. The idea is for me to basically replace our floating point numbers (doubles) to use my new classes that keep track of the floating point AND the units.  If somebody tries to use units improperly (such as adding m/s with s) then it will have a compiler error.  

So I ran across this equation that my stuff doesn't like:

Ve = Vo + D * ( r x l )

Where D is a directional cosine matrix (no units) and r is in radians/second and l is in meters.  The V's are velocities so they are m/s. (btw, ""x"" is cross product)

So it seems to me, that ""r x l"" would be a vector that is in radian*meters/second rather than merely meters/second.  That instead of the top part of r being radians, it should be unitless so that the overall units end up m/s like the velocities.

This code (and equation) has been working forever, so I'm 99.99% sure it's not in error.  What am I missing?",0

3- What is shortest possible arrangements to reach X or a close number to X with respect to (1)?  for example 24 can be written as 20+4 or 4+4+4+4+4+4 and 20+4 is shorter than the latter.

"I have a weird question(s) having to do with the Fibonacci sequenceI was once in my friend's studio looking at a barrel. I got to thinking about fun ways to paint the barrel. I've always been fascinated with the Fibonacci sequence and thought ""what if I painted the first slat, skipped the next, painted the next two, skipped the next three, etc."" 

I realized that in order to paint the whole barrel, I'd be doing quite a few second coats. From there, the question expanded. How many laps around a barrel of slat number N would it take to paint the whole barrel, following the rule paint, skip per corresponding Fibonacci term? I took to the notepad, and things got hairy. 

If we let N denote number of barrel slats, ""turn"" denote how many times around the barrel until all painted, and ""fib"" the Fibonacci term that finishes the barrel, you get (forgive formatting, am on mobile):

N=5; turn=3, fib=5
(Paint slat A, skib B, paint C D, skip E A B, paint C D E A B &lt;--- all slats painted)

N=6; turn=2, fib=5
N=7; turn=4, fib=13
N=8; turn=3, fib=13
N=9; turn=3, fib=13
N=10; turn=3, fib=13

And so on until

N=14; turn=5, fib=34

Excusing that this is just a curiosity, and probably a silly one at that, is there a more formal way to represent this? Is there an extant investigation? Which branch of mathematics should I go read about to get closer to understanding?

I think my original question was wondering whether there would ever be any N at which at least one slat would always be unpainted, but now I'm more curious as to whether there is any pattern or predictive formula to describe the relationship between N, turn, and fib.

Anyway, hopefully at least one of you enjoys this head scratcher.",0
"How do I notate for ""all subsets of a power set whose cardinality is n""?I don't study maths, so please forgive my ignorance.

So far, all I can write is

Update:

I've just discovered the concept is known as a ""*k*-combination"". I hope there is an easy notation for the set of all possible of such.

Update 2:

I think I've found the answer from Wikipedia. The set of all k-combinations of set X is notated: (*`X`_k_*). So I would write:

Question: Solve: 9\*tan(2x) - 18\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

Factor out a 9 and divide both sides by 9 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200B;

tan(2x) - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Replace tan(2x) with the double angle formula:

&amp;#x200B;

\[2\*tan(x) / 1 - tan\^2(x)\] - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Multiply all terms by 1 - tan\^2(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200B;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x)\[1 - tan\^2(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Distribute 2\*cos(x) to each term in the brackets:

&amp;#x200B;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x) + 2\*tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Factor out a 2 and divide both sides by 2 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200B;

tan(x) - cos(x) + tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Replace all tan(x) with \[sin(x)/cos(x)\] and cancel one of the cos(x):

&amp;#x200B;

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos\^2(x)\]\*cos(x) = 0

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Multiply all terms by cos(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) - cos\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Replace cos\^2(x) with \[1-sin\^2(x)\] and simplify:

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) - \[1-sin\^2(x)\] + sin\^2(x) = 0

sin(x) - 1 + sin\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

2\*sin\^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Factor this as a quadratic equation:

&amp;#x200B;

(2\*sin(x) - 1\]\[sin(x) + 1\] = 0

&amp;#x200B;

Set each factor = 0 and solve for x:

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) = 1/2

x = pi/6 or 5pi/6

&amp;#x200B;

sin(x) = -1

x = 3pi/2

&amp;#x200B;

These solutions are correct, but so is x = pi/2. Why doesn't this solution show up in my work? Where did I go wrong?",0

"formula with two unknown and four known variables : help solving for two unknownsGreetings to all.  This isn't a 'homework' problem; it's more of an issue that I've reached the limit of my imagination and can't find a solution.  A friend asked me for help, so I said I'd try.  This equation involves four KNOWN variables and TWO unknown variables, and I've been able to solve for any ONE variable, but not for two.  


This is a formula for calculating ratios of two substances of varying concentrations, expressed in milligrams per millilitre.  The goal is to come up with a mix of the two substances that together give a desired concentration and desired volume.

The variables are:   
a: volume of Substance One, in millilitres  
b: concentration of Substance One, in milligrammes per mL  
c: volume of Substance Two, in mL  
d: concentration of Substance Two, in mg/mL  


x: total volume of Substance One and Substance Two, in mL  
y: product concentration, in mg/mL

a + c = x  


wherein b and d, and x and y are defined by user input.  The concentrations of the two Substances are known, as are the desired total volume and desired end concentration.  The values of a and c are the ones I'd like to be able to work out.  


I'm able to come up with formulae for solving for any one variable.  E.G.:   
a = ( c \* ( y - d ) ) / ( b - y )  


... but that's dependent upon another variable I'm trying to solve for, var c .  So I can't plug that into an Excel spreadsheet because it can't crank out a value if there's an unknown in there.    


Here's an example using known values:   
a = 1 mL  
b = 100 mg/mL  
c = 2 mL  
d = 25 mg/mL  
x = 3 mL  
y = 50 mg/mL  


therefore: ( 1 ml \* 100 mg\\mL ) + ( 2 mL \* 25 mg\\mL ) = 3 mL \* 50 mg\\mL   


I know that there's only one possible solution (no pun intended) for vars a and c, if given the concentrations of One and Two, the desired concentration, and the desired volume.

Here's a snapshot of the Excel spreadsheet in progress: yellow fields are user input, grey fields are calculations, and orange fields are for calculated output.  At this point, I put values into the 'output' fields so the 'calculation' fields could have something to chew on.

"Generalized Mean of a Function?So the generalized mean can be written like this:

However, the generalized mean of a function confuses me because I'm not sure where the new function would go. Maybe just apply it to both sides, but then it's not really mean of the function, rather function of the mean.

Is weighted mean just an entirely different thing?",0

"Levi Civita on a geometric manifoldHi guys, I ran into a question while reading some stuff on differential geometry, and got confused by some posts online. I was hoping to find some help here.

Consider the Levi-Civita tensor on a manifold, identified on the tangent plane locally. Since we have the covariant and contravaraint forms of the tensor, I was curious about whether there were identities relating the levi-civita tensor (or a product of 2 of them) to the metric itself. Further, I was also curious about taking local coordinate derivatives ($\\partial\_{x\_j} \\text{det}g$) of the determinant of the metric with the Levi-Civita tensor method.

So i add those images (video) on the mirror object so when player looks at it, it looks like mirror actually reflecting. But here comes the problem. In real world what we see on mirror is actually a horizontally flipped image of what is being reflected and that is how reflection works, pure physics. but I am recording the image through a camera so it showing me a wrong reflection. In order to correct it all i need to do is flip the output horizontally. Now there are many functions and programs in the software that can help me achieve this but no matter what i tried it smartly figured out that i was trying to flip it so it never flipped. as if it was sentient. Like literally. So there is one last option for me and that is to manually mathematically flip the image to get the desired result.

"What is the complexity-class (P, NPhard, etc) of this category of unitary transforms from n bits to n bits of reversing xor(in,out) of sequence of (n choose m)*((2^m)!) unitary transforms of m bits to m bits, chosen randomly from ((n choose m)*((2^m)!))! poss unitary transforms of n bits to n bits?For example, if m is 4 then there are ((2\^4=16)!)=20922789888000 possible unitary transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits, and if n=256 then there are 256 \* 255 \* 254 \* 253 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 =  174792640 combos of 4 bit vars of n bits, each of which has 20922789888000 possible unitary transforms. If we take all those pairs of {combo of 4 bit vars} and {possible unitary transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits} and choose a random order of those, then its still within Polynomial and not NPhard if m=4 is constant, and the whole sequence has exactly 2 \^ n possible inputs and 2 \^ n possible outputs, though not all possible unitary transforms of n bits to n bits are in there, I strongly suspect exponentially many of the hard-to-reverse ones of them are.

More optimizable, instead of ((2\^4=16)!) transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits, the majority op on 3 bits to 1 bit, with all 8 choices of NOT vs IDENTITY, costs 2 bits to 4 choose 1 then costs 3 bits to NOT vs IDENTITY so costs only 32 possible unitary transforms and is still NPhard since any NPhard transform can be built of combos of majority op with optional NOTs, and there is no bias of specific values of the 3 bits read since all 8 NOT vs IDENTITY of them are used in 32 possible transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits. Or if you dont trust this optimization you could stick with all the ((2\^4=16)!) possible transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits.

My question is, what is the complexity-class of reversing something derived from both the input and output of this unitary transform of n bits to n bits, such as the n input bits XOR the n output bits? Since its trivial to calculate forward or backward (but not both at once), I strongly suspect that reversing the XOR of input and output is NPhard and therefore proof that P!=NP... but strongly suspecting is not proving. I'm not sure how to proceed in such a proof?

"Basic Meal Prep Math Question?Hi! So I have a weird and probably super simple math question I'm tangoing with.

I'm making a big meal prep spread sheet, and I've crunched down the calories and macro-nutrients of a recipe using a ratio format, with the key ingredient being the primary factor "" 1:x:y:z "" . For example, I'll have a recipe based around 1lb of chicken with all other ingredients are in ratios relative to said 1lb of chicken to keep cooking / scaling simple for large, multiple person meal prepping. The issue I'm running into is finding an optimal way to make calorie-tight serving sizes. I find out how many servings of ""X"" calories I can make, but every way I've come up with to separate the remainder / leftover seems like it may be more complicated than it needs to be.

For example, I have one ""recipe / ratio"" which comes out to about 1826 calories, dividing into 3.652, five-hundred calorie portions. What I want to figure out is the easiest way to, in the real world, divide my 1826 calories of food into 3 even portions with the remainder of 0.652 of a meal. The unit of measurement of course will be weight, which I don't have at the moment (which should be able to be mathematically translated from the calories themselves).

My attempts and why they suck:

Round up to the next # of portions. (So 3.65 rounds to 4). So if our recipe is 1826 calories, this makes four 456.5 cal servings. We know we want to end up with 3.65 total servings, so we take 0.35 of the fourth serving and distribute it among the original three. This isn't accurate as you have to distribute the 0.35 among the 3 full meals AND the 0.65 of a meal itself. I know I'm missing some super elementary details to make this work but I can't figure out what exactly  and it makes me feel dumb lol.

The other thing I tried that DOES work is dividing all 1826 calories by 3 portions, leaving me with 608.66 calories per portion. From there I could remove the extra 108.66 calories, or 17.85% per serving. This actually works, (which I just figured this out as I was creating the post), but I was still wondering if there is more elegant math or an equation I can plug in that might tell me how to portion things out from the beginning.

Tl;dr:

The idea is to cook the 1826 calories worth of food, weigh it, and then divide it into three 500 calorie portions with the 0.65 remaining off to the side in it's own mini portion for calorie tracking purposes. I have some ways to do so but I want to know if you smart folks have a more elegant solution.",0

"Formula for generating a tilted discBackground: I am building a 3d modeling solution that is bone first and model second. Usually the model is made first and a skeleton for animation is created second. I'm exploring the wonderful world of procedural content and ran into an issue with my current solution. 

What I have now: I found a formula that uses radius, theta, and phi to get the x,y,z coordinate for a point on a sphere. It is...

    X = radius * sin phi * cos theta
    Y = radius * sin phi * sin theta
    Z = radius * cos phi

My theta and phi are based on the current iteration index multiplied by the number of radians I need per iteration to reach 2pi. The other is some constant fraction like pi/2 or 5pi/4. Different combinations of 1 being constant and the other being iterative gives me a good variety of angles, but the issue is that the solution does not work for 3d rotations that are not aligned to at least 1 axis. I figure that is because of the constant value during iteration, but when I try to iterate both values I end up with something crazy. 

My goal: what I have now allows me to generate a disc tilted an arbitrary amount with a single iteration. I want to be able to create a disc of points and in that same iteration calculate their XYZ for their final rotation. Traditionally one would generate a disc facing y+ and then do rotation. Or for a *modern* solution, generate the disc, parent the disc to a transform, and rotate the transform. I would like to avoid having to do something like that. 

Some college friends suggested quaternions but I'm not sure how to use them on a set of points or on individual points as they're being generated. If there is some other solution or a way to get the solution I have now to work, I'd really like to know! Thanks. 

A simple example, I would like to be able to create a ring if points the surface of which is perpendicular to the angle between the points (0,0,0) and (5, 10, 10).

--edit: a few more details that come to mind

I'm targeting webgl for the first build. I am not against doing this in multiple steps, I just care about performance. If creating a disc facing y+ and then using a rotation matrix to move all the points will be more performant than doing several sin/cos/etc calculations to get the final point in a single step I have no problem going with that. And since this is a math forum I wouldn't expect that concern to be taken into account and I would be happy to benchmark multiple solutions to see what works best!

--edit 2: I'm targeting webgl so I have threejs to make some boilerplate stuff simpler. I just found out that the geometry buffer class's lookAt implementation applies a transform to its geometry instead of itself (like unity transform would). So I think I will be able to get away with generating a circle of points, setting them as the geometry data for the geometry buffer, using lookAt to move the points, and then adding the tilted points to my target mesh. I will bench mark this against my current flawed solution to see how much overhead (?) this step adds. Might also be worth checking the underlying implementation and using that directly so I don't have to construct a geometry buffer. 

Sorry that got so far off topic from the underlying math!",0

"[Trigonometry] Represent normal vector with angle in three-dimensional spaceI'm sorry if this question is a bit abstract. But basically in two dimensional space you can represent a normalized vector with an angle, like this.

Also you can draw a circle with radius of 1 and any normalized vector will lie on that circle.

I'm wondering if you can represent a vector in three dimensional space in similar fashion, with an angle? And would it be correct to assume that all the normalized vectors in this space lie on a sphere with radius of 1?",0
"Calculating the volume with integralI want to calculate the volume on a bottle of wine with integral. But I got stuck on the bottleneck.

2) in A, B and C there can only be one and only plane. Plane beta.
3) if d is perpendicular to alpha, then d is perpendicular to b and c.

"Calculating grade needed for AThis seems a little complicated and I am not sure of the method. Also, it's thankfully not for a math course.

So the syllabus indicates 6 categories of grades, and each category will average all the grades given for projects and homework in that category. Then those averages are weighted according to how much % that category is of the final grade.

Categories are weighted as follows:

1. 25% Midterm Portfolio Review
1. 20% Sketchbook Exercises
1. 10% Critiques
1. 25% Major Projects Average
1. 10% Class Participation
1. *10% Dropped Category*

**100% Final Average** (not a category)

Now, what complicates matters is that one of the categories was for an assignment the instructor dropped, due to lack of time. So the other 90% need to be ""redistributed"" to become the whole 100% of what we will be graded on. I am not sure how to do that.

Here are my current averages, by category:

1. 80
1. 100
1. 100
1. --- (see below)
1. 100 (hopefully)

"Convergence rate of euler integrationHey everyone,

I'm doing numerics and I'm simulating a simple linear pendulum with eulers method.

I understand that the convergence of euler is 1, meaning that by halving the stepsize dt, the accumulated error at a certain time should halve as well.

I simulated the pendulum for one period and then examined the accumulated error for different dt. In my calculations, the convergence rate is much higher than 1, actually roughly 2.2. Is that normal? Is the convergence rate just a lower bound? (I also tried it with half a period and 100 periods)

I'm really confused by this. I also implemented Runge Kutta methods, and with them the convergence rate comes out precisely as expected.

edit: Here is a plot of the residual against the used time step

 figured it out. When running the system only for a quarter period T/4 and compare the numerical solution to the analytical result, I recover the convergence rate of 1 for the euler.

I'm guessing in this simple system, when going through the entire sine wave, some of the accumulated errors somewhat cancel out.",0

"Probability QuestionHey, everyone! I've been trying to find a fair way to balance rolling for stats in D&amp;D.   
How I went about this is assuming the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) is the most balanced. That means an average of 12 and a combined total of 72. I originally went about it like this:   
72=6(x((y+1)/2)) or 24=x(y+1), where x=number of dice rolled and y=maximum possible roll.  
This originally didn't work since I wanted both x to be a positive integer and y to be an even integer. I fixed the problem by assuming you re-roll all 1s, making the new minimum 2:  
24=x(y+2)  
I plotted this function and found some really good settings that worked.   
X|Y  
2|10  
3|6  
4|4  
The table means the players are offered a choice of rollings 2d10s, 3d6s, or 4d4s. On all of these rolls, players will re-roll all 1s.   
The problem I've encountered with my players is so far, the 3 players that have already rolled for stats have achieved totals above 72. All of them chose to roll 3d6s, re-rolling all ones.   


My question: Are these actually fair ways to roll dice assuming a fair average is 12? Is there something I'm not accounting for  that might change the average? If it is a fair way, how can I reduce the the variance in stat totals my players get?   
(As a heads-up, my guess is I did not account for standard deviation and I still would not know how to account for standard deviation in a probability question.)

\-The number of agents I have

\-the numbers of hours they work new leads a day, and days they work a month.

\-the per agent sales goal amount

\-The average amount of time per connected call.

\-The contact rate I get at each 'bid' price level (how likely it is the 'lead' answers the phone, Grouped by dollar amount) 

\-The conversion to sale rate at each bid price level

  


I realize this is complex, but I have feel like I have all the metrics here to put together an equation. Example of the numbers below:

\-Average call time per connected call: 10 minutes.

 \-Marketing partner 2: $8-25%, $12-37%, $24-48%

 \-Marketing partner 3: $15 - 50%, $25 - 65%, $40 - 75%

The mass of a student in a group is X kg, where X follows N(70,9) distribution. In a sample of 4 observations find the probability that:

a) total mass of all students is less than 300 kg

b) the heaviest student has a mass less than 75 kg

&amp;#x200B;

So I have problem with both of these. In the first one I'm not sure what to use as a sd of the sample.  I think it should start like this (4\*70-300)/... but I have no idea what the denominator should be.

"Not a Math Question but a Question to Mathematicians.As a student of economics (please don't stop reading out of disregard for my kind) I have heard that more 'sciency' people, specifically mathematicians or physicist, as they are so well educated in the mathematical realm, logic and reasoning (almost regardless of the domain), are criticising the logic in economics. I am not fully aware of what they mean, whether it is in the assumptions, in the reasoning for those assumptions (""on average true"") on the reasoning methods in causalities or what, I guess just pick what you want to criticise.

I myself am now interested, with the intent of improving that, at least in the areas of my interest, what's so fundamentally wrong in our reasoning that is laughable to call that science. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sure am not offended if you want to speak freely and honestly how you fell about economics, and I am not here to convince you that economics is a harder science that maths (actually had to giggle myself), I'm just here for some input to improve, at least my, economic reasoning.",0
"Need help converting value of $ to a virtual currencyI have a system that gives away ""tickets"" either for free over a span of time for watching a video stream for x amount of time, or they can buy tickets with tips, subscriptions, etc.

The issue is, this system needs to be profitable. Anyone can eventually earn enough tickets to get the more expensive prizes for free (Merchaindise other tangible items that costs physical $)

A subscription costs $5. I would like it to be possible to be able to earn roughly $5 worth of tickets over 3 months. ( 90 days )

So for 3 months, they will earn $1.66 worth of tickets per month. about 0.027$ per day.The tickets are distributed every 10 minutes over a span of 4 hours max. I cannot change this interval.

So, if 1000 tickets = $10, what value **rounded by an integer** are my tickets? How many tickets should be given out per 10 minutes / 4 hours to meet the 1.66$ value by the end of the month?",0

"Conditional Dice ProbabilityI'm trying to calculate (what I understand to be) hypergeometric distribution of d6's, given particular conditions at specific die pool numbers.
My desired outcomes are 5's and 6's, but for every 4 additional dice (5, 9, 13, so on) I can include a single 4 as a desired outcome. How do I calculate this?

I'll include some samples below as reference and any help is greatly appreciated.

4 Dice: 2, 4, 5, 1
A single hit. I have not added 4 dice to the first die, so I do not include the 4 as a hit.

6 Dice: 2, 4, 5, 1, 6, 1
Three hits! The 5 and 6, and since I have added at least 4 (but not yet 8) dice to the first die, I may include the 4 as a hit.

"Confusing definitions of polyhedron.Hi.

So I'm doing a course on linear programming and my books first defines polyhedrons as

S = {x | Ax &lt;= b } 

which is the definitions I've seen in other places. Then, in the following sections it uses the following definition:

S = {Ax=b, x &gt;= 0}

without a word on how they are equivalent. The first time I assumed it was a typo, but it is written this way many times. 

I can't see how you can switch from one to another. For me the second definition includes only the intersection of the frontier of the polyhedron and the first quadrant/octant/whatever. Any help?
