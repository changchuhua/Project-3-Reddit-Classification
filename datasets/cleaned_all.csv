8,"measurement accuracy of the speed of lighti'm aware that the speed of light is defined to be 299792458 m/s, and that since 1983 the length of a meter has been defined with reference to that value.

according to wikipedia,

&gt;after centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be 299792458 m/s  \[...\] with a measurement uncertainty of 4 parts per billion.

this seems a small amount of uncertainty, but not necessarily so small that an improvement (say to 1 part per trillion) would be practically insignificant.

if measurements of the speed of light were to improve, such that scientists would (in theory) want to add a decimal place to the previous value of c and be confident that this was more accurate, then--unless they were to just ignore this result--according to si rules the length of a meter would have to change very slightly, in order to preserve the correctness of c = 299792458 m/s.

google hasn't enlightened me regarding whether, as of 2019, the speed of light has been measured more accurately than it was in 1975, or 1983. does anyone know whether this is the case, and if so whether the length of a meter has changed since then?",1,measurement accuracy speed lighti m aware speed light defined   m s  since   length meter defined reference value  according wikipedia   gt after centuries increasingly precise measurements    speed light known   m s   measurement uncertainty   parts per billion  seems small amount uncertainty  necessarily small improvement  say   part per trillion  would practically insignificant  measurements speed light improve  scientists would  in theory  want add decimal place previous value c confident accurate  then unless ignore result according si rules length meter would change slightly  order preserve correctness c     m s  google enlightened regarding whether     speed light measured accurately       anyone know whether case  whether length meter changed since then

13,"'the persistent illusion of transience'hi all,

earlier today i listened to an interesting interview with alan moore. he mentioned his belief that all that happens in the universe is predetermined and recurs forever. he said that this accords with einstein's (source of the above quote) theory of the universe and also made the rather grand claim that 'most modern physicists' agree with him. is this true? 

my 'field' is philosophy and it struck me how similar this was to nietszche's eternal recurrence, which was also referenced by moore in the interview. that may be a useful point of comparison for my understanding of the topic if you have read any nietszche. 

my knowledge of physics is limited to having watched cosmos (i am aware that space-time is a thing) and high school physics so i wondered if someone with a bit more authority on the subject could help a brother out. links to reading much appreciated.

cheers!

p.s. i am up for discussing the possible impact of such a theory on moral philosophy if anyone is interested in that side of things. it has always struck me that the laws of science seem to be at loggerheads with our understanding of morality. how can we have free will if we know that all matter in the universe acts and interacts in accordance with certain rules?",1, the persistent illusion transience hi all  earlier today listened interesting interview alan moore  mentioned belief happens universe predetermined recurs forever  said accords einstein s  source quote  theory universe also made rather grand claim  most modern physicists  agree him  true   field  philosophy struck similar nietszche s eternal recurrence  also referenced moore interview  may useful point comparison understanding topic read nietszche  knowledge physics limited watched cosmos  i aware space time thing  high school physics wondered someone bit authority subject could help brother out  links reading much appreciated  cheers  p s  discussing possible impact theory moral philosophy anyone interested side things  always struck laws science seem loggerheads understanding morality  free know matter universe acts interacts accordance certain rules 
14,"what are ways of conveying decibels into more graphable units (e.g. watts, joules)?so i'm doing an assignment where i have to conduct my own science experiment, and i've chosen to do one that relates to the law of conservation: i drop a golf ball and measure the volume of the impact, in decibels. the independent variable is the height from which i drop the ball. 

i'm already aware that different decibel measurements can't be graphed linearly that easy, since decibels work based on intensity (and stuff relating to how ears perceive sound), but i'm very sure that there's a way to demonstrate a linear trend from my results. 

all my measurements so far include:

* mass of the ball (having a ball means i don't have to worry about the way it lands when i drop it).

* distance from the decibel meter.

* ambient decibel levels (the environment). 

* heights from which the ball was dropped (of course).

* resulting decibel levels. 

so while i have lots of numbers written down, i'm not too sure what to do with these. the most legitimate formula i've seen and can use would be:

db = 10 x log10(w / 10^-12)

where db is the decibel level, w is the power of the sound wave (in watts) and 10^-12 is supposed to be the ""reference power"" (something about the atmosphere, also in watts).

26,"could physicists fact check this video for me? it's called ""quantum mechanics debunks materialism""[ video has almost 90,000 views and the comments are overwhelmingly positive. 

&amp;#x200b;

this video claims that: ""quantum mechanics conclusively debunks materialism and the notion of  there being an objective reality or physicality. these notions have been killed since the 1920s. reality is not material, not objective, and it  is not a linear rational clockwork machine..."" 

&amp;#x200b;

he also says this about quantum fields:

&gt; qm says that there are no such thing as particles (really). everything  is fields. a particle is really just a field. it is a cloud of  possibilities. when you look upon this cloud with some instrument or  with your own eyes or with your own consciousness what happens is that a  cloud congeals and collapses into a particular result. these fields are  interesting because mathematically a field is an infinite set of  scalars, so that means you take every single point in space and you put a  number on it that will be a field. \[...\] there’s a branch of science  called qft says that basically everything is a field and reality is an  interaction of different fields coming together, now, what’s interesting  about fields is its nothing but values but values of what? the answer  is nothing. there is nothing there, a field is infinite nothingness.  

&amp;#x200b;

also, at around 53 minutes, he uses an elephant as an example, and he says that according to qm: 

&gt;when you're not looking at an elephant, and this is just a metaphor, that elephant exists as every other animal that it could have possibly been. think about that and really think through the radical consequences of this, it's enormous. when you're not looking at an elephant, that elephant is literally infinite. it's every possible elephant that could ever possibly be that you could ever see or any other creature could see... not only that but it also exists as a kangaroo, as a chipmunk, as a rhinoceros... and then when you look at it it collapses down into that particular elephant that you see. that's a good metaphor for superposition.

&amp;#x200b;

he then says that when you drop your kid off at school, and you don't see them: ""that child exists as infinity, it's nothingness. when you 're not looking at the elephant it's infinity, it's nothingness.""

 

in the video he also replies to the objection that ""observers"" in physics doesn't have to be a conscious human, and that it could also be a laser or a detector, but he replies to this objection by saying that the laser and detectors and computers exist within your consciousness as well. 

&amp;#x200b;

39,"em wave attenuation &amp; reflection q's hi everyone,

as the title suggests, i'm interested in em wave degradation and reflection. i understand that it depends heavily on the frequency/wavelength, and i'm interested specifically in the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands (wi-fi).

my understanding is that the higher the frequency, the lower the the piercing capabilities of said radio waves. my question is, is there an average value of degradation through common materials like a wall? or through air? i.e passing through a cinder brick wall, a 2.4ghz will degrade by x%, or 5ghz by y%, or traveling xm the radio wave loses z%.

my next next question is similar to the one above. how significant is reflection in the first two situations? for example, would a wall ever reflect more than it lets pass through?

if it helps, i'm only concerned about small areas &lt; 30m

45,"how do you prove that the summ of momentum of 2 objects in a closed system stays the same when both objects move and rotate?i wanted to program a simulation of 2 objects colliding, taking into account that they can rotate and that rotation and speed of the objects change before/after collision.
now i want to prove that the collision happened correctly, that my model works. just that i dont know how to do that, as i dont know how i can add up translation and rotation.

ps: a bit more about what my model is:
first off my objects are solid and are defined by mass, certain point array and moment of inertia .
currently i dont really care how and if the objects are colliding but rather how they get accelerated by springs. so when 2 objects collide , in my simulation its just 2 objects moving at each other and between a spring, the spring gets compressed,  acts a force on both objects which then gives the objects a certain force and certain torque, the objects get pushed away. if the center of mass of the objects are aligned with the spring, its just a normal conservation of linear momentum, but as soon as rotation comes into play i dont know how to prove that my model works. miss-aligned there is a case where both objects suddently move downwards and with spin, but then you would think that something has to move upward too so that linear momentum would conserve.

the spring itself is more a construct, it has no mass, and the exerted force is really just calculated by how much it is pressed together without boundaries as followed: f = k*d (f= force, k= constant i randomly appoint to fit my needs, d= distance how far the spring is pressed in (as in d = (length when relaxed) - (current length of the spring))) 

i have to say that my approach is fairly naive as i really just wanted to try to be able to simulate a so called collision even when the bodies can rotate and be able to include cases where for example an object rotates fast, hits another object as then the object accelerates but rotates slower. like linear and angular momentum are linked together but as i think it works is that angular momentum can be transferred to linear momentum right? i dont exactly know how that works and hope to be able to understand it better with a simulation, in case of only linear simulation it works. 

i apologize to not be able to shorten this and that this whole project is rather shaky but im thankful for everyone reading this, ""wasting their time"" and trying to help me.

right now, i am getting a bit tripped up about the scenario where a ball is rolling up an incline and not slipping.

&amp;#x200b;

when i draw the force body diagram, i believe that the normal force points upward, the force of gravity points down and to the left, and the frictional force points right (uphill). is it right to say that the frictional force must point uphill because the ball must spin clockwise to move to the right? i feel like this might be an incomplete answer.

additionally, why does the frictional force affect the force, but not the gravitational force? (more explanation into this question below)

the first questions is not problematic. given e\^2 = m\_0\^2 \* c\^4 + p\^2 \* c\^2 one can easily calculate that m\_0\^2 \* c\^4 = 20 (gev)\^2 and thus e' = sqrt(45) gev  ≈  6.7 gev.

when i tried to solve the second question i did the following:

the velocity of the particle in s can be calculated with e = (m\_0 \* c\^2)/sqrt(1 - v\^2/c\^2)  =&gt; v = (2/3) c.

76,"grade 11 physics - mechanical wavesi am having some confusion regarding mechanical waves. some of the wave reflects invertly when going from a less dense to more dense medium, or when a wave comes in contact with a fixed end. waves reflect upright when going from a more dense to a less dense medium, or when a wave comes in contact with a free end.

&amp;#x200b;

here is my confusion: aren't mechanical waves faster, the more dense the medium is?

in my answer key for my homework, when the wave is going from a high speed rope to a low speed chain, the wave is reflected inverted. and when the wave is going from a low speed chain to a high speed rope, the wave is reflected upright. i am confused.

if we follow what the question says, isn't a low speed chain a lesser dense medium, so since it has a lower speed, the wave should be reflected inverted when going from the low speed chain to the high speed rope? similarly, when going from a high speed rope to a low speed chain, shouldn't the wave be reflected upright?

based off what my answer key is saying, is the high speed rope the lesser dense medium, and the low speed chain the more dense medium, and why? does the behaviour of speed with regards to density change when it is in a rope?

if i understand correctly, the modern interpretation of the 4 fundamental forces is that they are in essence caused by an exchange of particles (gluons, for example). this, to me, makes no sense at all. i see a particle exchange as a single event, a point in time, whereas the force experienced by two particles is something constant (for example, the idea of the gravitational force as a deformation in spacetime makes sense to me). furthermore, how does the information about interactions ""travel"" and get exchanged through these particles?

people usually say quantum mechanics does not make sense intuitively; personally, i disagree. quantum mechanics requires you to abandon your ""version"" of intuitive understanding; it requires you to realize that what you consider *obvious*, what makes sense immediately to you, is just a product of you being born and raised in an environment in which the physical laws assume a particular form (due to large masses in comparison to subatomic particles and small velocities in comparison to the speed of light). this is just to say that i believe there must exist an intuitive way to describe this idea of forces being exchanges of particles, and i kindly ask you to try and find it. :)",1,making sense carrier particleshi everybody  exactly field study  i m phd student chemistry  i m fascinated aspects physics  always like least intuitive understanding every topic come across  understand correctly  modern interpretation   fundamental forces essence caused exchange particles  gluons  example  this  me  makes sense all  see particle exchange single event  point time  whereas force experienced two particles something constant  for example  idea gravitational force deformation spacetime makes sense me  furthermore  information interactions  travel  get exchanged particles  people usually say quantum mechanics make sense intuitively  personally  disagree  quantum mechanics requires abandon  version  intuitive understanding  requires realize consider  obvious  makes sense immediately you  product born raised environment physical laws assume particular form  due large masses comparison subatomic particles small velocities comparison speed light  say believe must exist intuitive way describe idea forces exchanges particles  kindly ask try find it   
79,"what factors decide whether a plasma is generated from electric potential?context: i'm trying to build a diy sputtering rig. 
for anyone unfamiliar with the concept, sputtering deposits one material onto another. this is achieved by generating a plasma with high voltage, which bombards one electrode with ions, causing molecules to migrate from that end onto whatever it is you are sputtering onto.

i'm stuck on getting the plasma to form though. 

i have a glass chamber, which i pump out as much air as i can from, flush it with argon and repeat a couple of times. 

i then have a metal bottom lid and an insulated wire going to the top end of the glass jar. i have applied several different voltages to these electrodes, up to 25 kv, without getting a plasma to form. i keep getting either arcs or just a corona effect, but no full blown plasma.

i know some things about my rig could be better:
* i think a higher vacuum would be good. i've only measured it with a jury rigged meter, but i estimate it's probably around 0.2-0.3 bar. i can't do much about this right now though.
* the high voltage right now is a heavily offset ac. it could be seen mostly as a pulsed dc source though. 2-4 khz, ~15 kv, ~10-15 ma. this ought to suffice i think?

but the major thing i'm unsure of is the electrode shapes. as i mentioned, i am getting some corona effect on the top wire. is it important whether this electrode has a big area pointed toward the other electrode? i don't feel i have a good enough understanding of what determines if a plasma forms instead of an arc. or are they the same?",1,factors decide whether plasma generated electric potential context  i m trying build diy sputtering rig  anyone unfamiliar concept  sputtering deposits one material onto another  achieved generating plasma high voltage  bombards one electrode ions  causing molecules migrate end onto whatever sputtering onto  i m stuck getting plasma form though  glass chamber  pump much air from  flush argon repeat couple times  metal bottom lid insulated wire going top end glass jar  applied several different voltages electrodes    kv  without getting plasma form  keep getting either arcs corona effect  full blown plasma  know things rig could better    think higher vacuum would good  i ve measured jury rigged meter  estimate probably around         bar  can t much right though    high voltage right heavily offset ac  could seen mostly pulsed dc source though      khz     kv       ma  ought suffice think  major thing i m unsure electrode shapes  mentioned  getting corona effect top wire  important whether electrode big area pointed toward electrode  feel good enough understanding determines plasma forms instead arc  same

87,"illuminated lightbulb on lamp casts a shadow when using a flashlighti noticed if you shine a flashlight on an illuminated lightbulb in a lamp it will cast a shadow behind the lightbulb. is this shadow just a contrast to the surrounding brightness around the bulb or is the light from the flashlight illuminating the inside of the lightbulb of the lamp to make it white which reflects the other light and thus making a shadow? 

so whatever the case, you can pretty much direct light to cast a shadow behind another light. if that area behind the lamp bulb represented a 1 when illuminated and a 0 when there is a shadow, it is useful to have the ability to make that area dark without having to turn off the lamp but instead use light. 

i bet you could make a logic tree based on the speed between different lights and the shadows created along its travel. in computing you have the transistor to gate the signal but with the path of the light and another light you could simulate gating.

i'm aware of the distinction between ""rule"" and ""law"", but if the latter were used the wording could be condensed to ""existence has only a few laws"" and the intended contrast would not be expressed. anyway, there might be millions of them.


**2. complexity is not a matter of elements but relationships.**

it almost sounds like a trivial statement to me, but i'm not even certain if it's actually true. the word ""elements"" is meant to include the actual elements, but also particles, abstractions or any other discretely definable object.

the thing is, the education system in which i study physics (french) is not very representative of what physics really is. we barely do any mathematics and while our math program is good, i've only done math-related physics (so basically physics) at additional classes i took and summer camps i went to because i was curious. i genuinely feel like physics is for me, i love the class, the subject, and i can't wait to finally understand most of the posts on /r/physics and here honestly. i'm terrified of arriving next year and falling behind everyone because i lack the knowledge most people acquired as high school students. i've never taken any classes in english (i did in spanish and french) and while my mathematical skills are okay, i've never done any differential equations for example. i want to learn this summer and i wanted to know if anyone had advice and maybe resources i could look into to get familiar with the english way of saying some terms. also, what were your experiences as undergraduates in physics? were you excelling in high school? it's still way too early for me to look into subfields but i love reading about exoplanets, particle physics and nuclear physics (so basically, three widely different fields). i actually got an internship at a firm linked with the iter program and am also going to the cea nuclear research center in a few weeks and gosh, i'm so excited.

1. it collides at y = maximum height of the projectile,
2. it collides at y = half the maximum height of the projectile
3. it collides at an instant where its velocity = v\_ball/2

the solution given: 

particles exciting the first filter will be in the (1, 0, 0)\^t (transpose)  state (s(z) basis). particles passing the filter will be in the eigenstate of the `$b \cdot s$`  opperator, which is = b(cos \* s(z) + sin \* s(x))  (which becomes a matrix of cos and sin). 

the solution then states that the spin up eigen vector is 1/2(1+cos, sqrt(2) sin, 1-cos). 

then the inner product \^2 of this with the spin up z basis vector is  1/4 (1+cos(theta))\^2.

148,"question about force of cars crashingi've recently learned that a car traveling at 50 mph, that crashes with another car traveling in the opposite direction at the same speed, has the same force as the original car hitting an immovable object at 50 mph. my understanding is that it's newton's 3rd law.

but this can't mean that the speed of the other car is completely irrelevant right? if we keep the first car's speed the same, what if the second car is traveling at 25 mph? or 100 mph? i'd assume the accident is worse when the other car is traveling at 100 mph. but if both cars having equal speed and one object being stationary are identical, then i can't figure out how to logic through 25 mph being any different then those two answers. (how could it be less force for the other car to be traveling at 25 mph than if it were standing still? and it can't be more force than if it were traveling at 50 mph right?) and if 25 mph is identical to 50 then i don't know why 100 would be different.

clearly my understanding is flawed. can someone please explain this? thank you.

152,"could the cosmological principle be wrong on even larger scales?hi there, i'm no cosmologist but i have a thought about the cosmological principle. for those who don't know the cosmological principle is the central assumption of cosmology, the assumption is that, when viewed on a large enough scale, the universe is homogenous (that is the distribution of material in the universe is without irregularities and uniform) and isotropic (it's the same in every direction).

i know this view is well supported by evidence of the cosmic microwave background radiation, but could it be the case that this only holds for within the observable universe (say for lengths less than 100 billion light years). could it be that the ""unobservable universe"" is not homogenous nor isotropic and we are viewing some tiny flat bit of a much larger manifold?

154,"linear distance as a function of rotational distance with a changing diameterhi all,

&amp;#x200b;

i'm making a roller shade from scratch controlled by the raspberry pi. in my program the user has the option to enter the height of the window in inches to set the max range of travel. this is converted to motor steps for the code to manipulate.

my shades are made from a piece of fabric taped to and wrapped around a 1"" wooden dowel. my theoretical equation is of course : distance = rotations\*pi\*diameter (1""). when i hooked it all up i realized that the diameter is not 1"" but in fact a function of how much of the fabric is still left? with the blinds spooled up the diameter is roughly 2"" so i tried averaging it out to use 1.5"" in the algorithm but it's still not accurate unless the height of the window entered is half of the length of the fabric.

i could use a piece-wise function, say every 6"" use a different diameter, but that is tedious and i know there has to be an efficient solution for this problem.

157,"relationship between the age of the universe and the mass of the universe?hi,

i've been doing some pondering recently and arrived at an interesting equation, where ꬱ is the age of the universe, m is mass and the other symbols are standard:

**m =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2g**

[here are the ponderings]( that got me to the equation.  i didn't actually have it in mind when i started writing, it just developed as part of the process.  i did however, do a lot of searching for ""mass of the universe"", ""density of the universe"",  ""volume of the universe"" and so on to make sure that my results were within the ballpark and i never saw anything like this equation.

&amp;#x200b;

is **m =  ꬱ.c****^(3)****/2g** a recognised relationship?

&amp;#x200b;

ps - i'm aware that there are some slight differences from measured values, but they are well within an order of magnitude in all cases.  note also that i've pondered aloud at the end of the document.  i'm not committed to the musings there, they are merely food for thought at the moment.  i'm also happy to change out ꬱ if there is a standard symbol for the age of the universe.

&amp;#x200b;

pps - (post edit) i've very slightly edited the text above, but i can't do anything about the title.  there's some sort of age of the universe and mass relationship, but it's possible that ""mass of the universe"" was poorly worded (as was mass of the (observable) universe).  i should have been more careful and said ""mass inside a sphere whose radius is the hubble length"".  i did get the equation via a consideration of the volume of the observable universe (and a volume associated with a sphere with the radius equal to the schwarzschild radius in which the density is equal to the current critical density of our universe) but i have since noted that i should have been thinking of something that i've called a ""light horizon"" but could also be called a ""hubble length sphere"" using wording from sean carroll.  i've also tightened my wording at the linked article.

&amp;#x200b;

ppps - (post edit of edit) nope, ""mass of the (observable) universe"" doesn't work either - edited to reflect.  i still think there's something interesting, but i'm thinking that it might already be understood but i have approached it from such an oblique angle that some experts can't see that i am talking about the bleeding obvious as if it were arcane.  clearly not being an expert means i can't see the bleeding obvious or put into words why what i am looking at is bleeding obvious :)  or the critical density having an apparent relationship with the age of the universe could just be no more than apparent after all and, if so, any conclusions drawn from it would likely be wrong.",1,relationship age universe mass universe hi  i ve pondering recently arrived interesting equation  ꬱ age universe  mass symbols standard   m   ꬱ c    g   here ponderings  got equation  actually mind started writing  developed part process  however  lot searching  mass universe   density universe   volume universe  make sure results within ballpark never saw anything like equation   amp x b   m   ꬱ c    g  recognised relationship   amp x b  ps   i m aware slight differences measured values  well within order magnitude cases  note also i ve pondered aloud end document  i m committed musings there  merely food thought moment  i m also happy change ꬱ standard symbol age universe   amp x b  pps    post edit  i ve slightly edited text above  can t anything title  there s sort age universe mass relationship  possible  mass universe  poorly worded  as mass  observable  universe  careful said  mass inside sphere whose radius hubble length  get equation via consideration volume observable universe  and volume associated sphere radius equal schwarzschild radius density equal current critical density universe  since noted thinking something i ve called  light horizon  could also called  hubble length sphere  using wording sean carroll  i ve also tightened wording linked article   amp x b  ppps    post edit edit  nope   mass  observable  universe  work either   edited reflect  still think there s something interesting  i m thinking might already understood approached oblique angle experts can t see talking bleeding obvious arcane  clearly expert means can t see bleeding obvious put words looking bleeding obvious   critical density apparent relationship age universe could apparent and  so  conclusions drawn would likely wrong

173,"request for feedback: the atemporal universe - resolving the problem of timei've written (or at least tried to write) a paper on the problem of time. it's a  philosophy of physics paper. any feedback (preferably constructive 😁) would be greatly appreciated. a critique of the ideas is of primary interest, but i know the formatting and structure need a lot of work too. anyway, here is the abstract from the paper:

this paper looks at a possible resolution of the “problem of time” which arises from the attempt to unify quantum mechanics (qm) and general relativity (gr), into a theory of quantum gravity. extending the principle of relativity to the concepts of synchronisation and simultaneity, in einsteinian relativity allows for the restoration of absolute simultaneity, which in turn helps to align the concepts of time in gr and qm. a further a change in perspective, as to how time is viewed in physics, shows how time is neither fundamental nor emergent, but is rather a defined system of measurement. this is in the same sense that the metric system [of measurement] - or indeed any other system of measurement - is neither fundamental nor emergent. this is to say that the universe is fundamentally atemporal or “timeless”. in viewing time as a system of measurement, we retain all the functional attributes that are currently attributed to time, in our contemporary physical theories. a relational interpretation of time is retained at the classical level, which can make sense of both the leibnizian and machian principles of time, while such a timeless interpretation is indistinguishable from the idea of absolute time. the reinterpretation of “time” as nothing more than a system of measurement also helps to address the issue of background dependence, which is part of the overall problem of arriving at a unified theory of quantum gravity. this paper also seeks to address the issue of background independence, albeit less directly.

i found the acceleration in the y direction:

f = ma

-29,000n = 1700kg * a

a = (-29000 kg m/s^2 ) /(1700kg)

= -17.1 m/s^2 

then i found the velocity in the y direction:

velocity = -17.1 m/s^2 * 0.037s

= -6.31 m/s

then i added the 2 vectors together and solved for the velocity using pythagorean theorem

vf = sqrt[(13 m/s)^2 + (-6.31 m/s)^2 ]

= 14 m/s

i then found the angle by doing 

tan theta = -6.31 m/s / 13 m/s

theta = tan^-1 (-6.31 m/s / 13 m/s)

theta = -26 degrees

182,"rod structural bending failure - hand calcsthis a pretty specific problem, not a hw problem but just theoretical (kind of connected to a personal project). not sure if it fits here, but i'll try. sorry for the poor formatting, done from mobile.

i just did hand calcs for theoretical bending failure of an aluminum rod, and i'm just looking to double check believing my results match reality.

so the parameters of the problem in question:
a 1/4"" al-6360 rod supporting a 1lb load 1m away.

made some simplifications to get:

f = 1 lbf ~= **5n**

l = **1m**

r (radius of rod) = 1/8in = **3.175e-3m**

tensile yield strength = **214mpa**


---------------------------
so, my calculations:

m = l x f = **5 nm**

i = (pi x r^4 ) / 4 = **7.981e-11 m^4**

max bending stress = (m x r)/i = **199mpa**

so, what i get from these calculations is that an approximately 1 lb mass at a 1m cantilever distance from the mounting point will cause a 1/4"" al rod to approach permanent deformation.

i am measuring the ratio of a set of compounds (a, b and c) in a solution at different time points. the absolute concentration of all of those compounds increases over time due to a constant influx - what i am interested in is what the ratio is in the influx, if that makes sense? the ratio in the influx will start at 100% a, and change over time to a constant, but different ratio - we assume that the majority of our time points captures this stable phase. 

to add a bit more information, what i am looking at are not different compounds, but different versions of the same compounds, differing only in their isotopic composition. the alternative to this approach would be to fully quantitate the different compounds in the influx, but i am somewhat worried about the reliability of this approach in our case.

the first experiment was basically a string attached to two masses, a 50g cork on one side, and a 50g weight hanger on the other. a tube with a paper clip was attached to a known radius of the string. it then involved spinning the upper part of the string with the cork, horizontal motion. then the amount of time for 30 revolutions, and after that adding more weight to the hanger and repeating.

i already did the first part of the sac, don't think i did well. i had to calculate centrifugal force, had no idea how to get the velocity but on my paper it said g=9.8m/s/s, so i used gravity as acceleration to calculate velocity. (which i have the feeling wasn't correct) t (period) and frequency also had to be calculated. i divided 30 by the amount of time it took for t, and then divided from 1 for frequency. those results had to then be showed in a centrifugal force vs frequency graph, with questions like what did the results show between fc and freq, (i simply wrote freq decreases as fc increases or something like that) were the disrepancies in results and why (unanswered) and i think something about tension? a second graph had to be drawn showing fc and freq^2 and a couple more questions for that one.

what is explained is consistent with what i've read in books such as [atomic accidents]( except for one small-ish detail is the claim of the main character who says that the rbmk reactor has a ""**negative heat coefficient**"" *not to be confused with the positive void coefficient*, meaning that the reactions slow down as the temperature rises in the reactor.

my question to you:  i've read in places like [here]( how a light water or liquid salt thorium reactor can have a negative heat coefficient, but i haven't seen any explanation of what property of the graphite-moderated rbmk reactor such as the one at chernobyl could have such a negative heat coefficient.  could you explain -- preferably using stick figures and three-letter words -- how the rbmk reactor had this property, if indeed it actually did?

1b) a large nucleus with rest mass m = 14700 mev/c2 is at rest in laboratory frame s. the proton collides with the nucleus and

to do this i know that i have to use momentum 4-vectors and use conservation of momentum in order to get the final velocity. i am trying to use the conservation of total momenta:

(p + q)\^2 = (p’ + q’)\^2

where p, q and p’, q’ are the momentum 4-vecotrs before and after the collision respectively. the initial 4-vectors are: p = m(c, v), q = m(c, 0). i think the final ones would be, p’ = 0 (since the proton is part of the nucleus) and q = m\*(c, u) where m\* = m + m and u is the velocity of the new nucleus. i only obtain 1.2461c which obviously isn’t possible. here’s where i’m stuck

i have tried to conceptualize the fission/fusiion process for a long time and have struggled with the traditional binding energy curve explanation you get in textbooks. the below is what icame up with...does it seem accurate/correct to you?

-----------------

i’m sure you have heard of albert einstein’s famous equation e=mc2; you may have even known it was related to nuclear engineering but not known how. what this equation means is that mass is related to energy and energy is related to mass and that it is possible for one to be expressed as the other.


for example as subatomic particles accelerate close to the speed of light (high energy) their mass actually increases tremendously as a direct result of the energy the particle has. that is why particle accelerators (think cern) have to be so massive to get that extra little push in speed for such tiny particles. (sadly it is also why we will never be able to travel as fast as light. (although bending space to effectively go faster than light may be possible.) energy can be measured as mass and mass can be measured as energy interchangeably. in a loose sense, one can think of energy as having mass.


okay, now this next part is probably the most intense part of the book, but it is crucial so please read carefully!


it may seem counterintuitive, however the sum of the individual parts of an atom always weigh slightly more than the complete bounded atom. thus, counter to the old addage, atoms “weigh less than the sum of their parts”. the reason for this is because individual unbound nucleons floating in space have a potential energy with respect to every other nucleon or nucleus created by the strong nuclear force. when nucleons are separated and unbound it is like a ball floating in the air. the ball has potential energy due to gravity compared to the surface of the earth. when the ball falls to the ground it looses that energy just as a nucleon looses energy when it “falls” into and binds with another nucleon or nucleus. 


according to the laws of energy conservation you probably leanred in high school physics, energy must be released in order for there to be an inelastic colission (i.e. where the two objects stick together). for example, two clumps of clay will deform or a falling plate will shatter and make noise. the potential energy has to be disipaited somehow or else the object cannot stay at the lower energy state and will rebound to some degree. the same is true for unbound nucleons. the energy from the binding must be released since the nucleons are going from a higher unbound energy state to a lower bound energy state. as shown with e=mc2 discussed above, that change in energy is reflected as a change in mass known as the “mass deficit” or “binding energy”, the amount of energy released by forming the atom. what is incredible is that this change in mass is real and actually measurable. 


this explains why energy is released when smaller nuclei are fused together in the fusion process. two smaller unbound nuclei are fused together and release the stored potential energy between them in the process. 

now at this point you may be wondering how it is possible that putting smaller nuclei together can release energy in the fusion process but breaking apart large nuclei into smaller components can also release energy in the fission process. in actuality, putting smaller parts together always releases energy even in the case of larger nuclei. however, unlike smaller nuclei in the fusion process, the large nuclei involved in nuclear fission have a tremendous amount of potential energy resulting from the electromagnetic repulsion of the protons in the nucleus. when energy is put back into the system via a high energy neutron, the nucleus deforms to the point where the strong force is no longer strong enough to hold the atoms together and the atom explodes due to the electrostatic repulsion caused by the protons. 


in a sense, in fission the energy is the result of the released electrostatic repulsion of the protons (i.e. electrostatic force), whereas in fusion the energy released is due to the loss of potential energy between unbound nucleons (i.e. a result of the strong nuclear force). just as in the fusion process, uranium atoms also released energy when they were formed eons ago in the center of a star, however that is not what is being harvested in the fission process. 


this explains why so much more energy is released by fusion as oppossed to fission. the nuclear strong force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force (as discussed earlier this is why atoms stay together) so releasing potential energy between nucleons due to binding releases much more energy than that which is released when at large atom explodes due to stored electrostatic repulsion caused by protons.",1,good explanation energy fission fusion comes from howdy all  tried conceptualize fission fusiion process long time struggled traditional binding energy curve explanation get textbooks  icame with does seem accurate correct you    i m sure heard albert einstein s famous equation e mc   may even known related nuclear engineering known how  equation means mass related energy energy related mass possible one expressed other  example subatomic particles accelerate close speed light  high energy  mass actually increases tremendously direct result energy particle has  particle accelerators  think cern  massive get extra little push speed tiny particles   sadly also never able travel fast light   although bending space effectively go faster light may possible  energy measured mass mass measured energy interchangeably  loose sense  one think energy mass  okay  next part probably intense part book  crucial please read carefully  may seem counterintuitive  however sum individual parts atom always weigh slightly complete bounded atom  thus  counter old addage  atoms  weigh less sum parts  reason individual unbound nucleons floating space potential energy respect every nucleon nucleus created strong nuclear force  nucleons separated unbound like ball floating air  ball potential energy due gravity compared surface earth  ball falls ground looses energy nucleon looses energy  falls  binds another nucleon nucleus  according laws energy conservation probably leanred high school physics  energy must released order inelastic colission  i e  two objects stick together  example  two clumps clay deform falling plate shatter make noise  potential energy disipaited somehow else object cannot stay lower energy state rebound degree  true unbound nucleons  energy binding must released since nucleons going higher unbound energy state lower bound energy state  shown e mc  discussed above  change energy reflected change mass known  mass deficit   binding energy  amount energy released forming atom  incredible change mass real actually measurable  explains energy released smaller nuclei fused together fusion process  two smaller unbound nuclei fused together release stored potential energy process  point may wondering possible putting smaller nuclei together release energy fusion process breaking apart large nuclei smaller components also release energy fission process  actuality  putting smaller parts together always releases energy even case larger nuclei  however  unlike smaller nuclei fusion process  large nuclei involved nuclear fission tremendous amount potential energy resulting electromagnetic repulsion protons nucleus  energy put back system via high energy neutron  nucleus deforms point strong force longer strong enough hold atoms together atom explodes due electrostatic repulsion caused protons  sense  fission energy result released electrostatic repulsion protons  i e  electrostatic force  whereas fusion energy released due loss potential energy unbound nucleons  i e  result strong nuclear force  fusion process  uranium atoms also released energy formed eons ago center star  however harvested fission process  explains much energy released fusion oppossed fission  nuclear strong force much powerful electrostatic force  as discussed earlier atoms stay together  releasing potential energy nucleons due binding releases much energy released large atom explodes due stored electrostatic repulsion caused protons

then with ""a"" i calculated ""w = a*(π/4)"" to find out the angular speed when the projectile is thrown.

with ""v = w * r"" (r is the length of the projectile arm) i find out the initial speed of the projectile, i used ""vx = vcos(45)"" and ""vy = vsen(45)"" to find the speeds.

in the end i used vy to find the fly time and from it i found the distance x.

254,"what was wrong with my thought process? (i dont need you to explain me the math, just the logic) 

i dont need you to explain me how to solve the following question, because i i already know that i can use the x - xo = vot + (at\^2)/2 formula to solve it; my problem is that i dont know why i can't use a=δv/δt instead. so, to the question:

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

""an object moving with uniform acceleration has a velocity of 12.0 cm/s in the positive x direction when its x coordinate is 3.00 cm. if its x coordinate 2.00 s later is 5.00 cm, what is its acceleration?""

&amp;#x200b;

the thing is, my thought process was: if the acceleration is equal to δv/δt, then i need to find the second velocity (the first is given, which is 12cm/s). so, i tried to find the second velocity by doing v=δs/δt, which is = 5-3/2-0, which ended up being 2/2, which was equal to 1cm/s. once i found that, i tried to find the acceleration by doing a=δv/δt. the first acceleration is 12m/s and the last was 1m/s, and the time was 2 seconds. so i did a= 1-12/2-0, therefore a= -5,5m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200b;

the answer, however, is -11m/s\^2.

&amp;#x200b;

so what was wrong in my thought process? is it because if a is constant, then i must assume that it is not equal to δv/δt ? if so, why is that? if not that, is it because a=δv/δt means only average acceleration and i must assume that if a is constant, then it must be instantaneous acceleration? if so, why? (lol, sorry for the bunch of questions.).

&amp;#x200b;

also, can i, instead of giving that answer, just maintain what i did, and just change it at the end, putting a= 1-12 = -11cm/s\^2 instead of a= 1-12/2-0? if so, is it because im supposed to ignore the time somehow or what? and if thats the case, why is that?

sep is saying that you can “pretend” your frame of reference is subject to fictitious forces (thinking in classical terms) arising from the fact that it is non-inertial (hence the need for locality, because fictitious acceleration would be constant throughout space).

gpr is saying that you can explain all fictitious forces as gravitational fields, which seems to be an equivalent statement to the previous.

the answer finds it simply by saying that loss = *a\*f\*d* (db).

*loss* (db) *= 10\*log(i / i\_0)* where *i / i\_0 =  exp(-μ\*d)*

i will be a junior this fall, but i decided to change my major to chemistry this past semester (from a non-science major) as i developed an interest in understanding more about how the world works. i took calculus i and general chemistry i, and am currently taking general chemistry ii as a summer class.

i find chemistry fascinating and enjoy understanding how matter interacts and changes form. yet, i noticed that i am more drawn to the areas of chemistry that share more in common with physics, such as electrochemistry, nuclear chemistry, and thermodynamics. i like that physics encompasses more than the scope of chemistry, including topics like mechanics, optics, and electricity and magnetism. i also enjoy the fundamentals of physics concepts and how they explain natural phenomenon. i like mathematics and would enjoy the challenge of applying calculus to solve physics problems.

i am considering either a degree in chemistry, with a physical chemistry concentration, or a degree in physics. (i would graduate a year later than originally intended if i chose to change to physics.) i know there is a lot of overlap between the two, and i have not decided which path i am more interested in pursuing. would it be reasonable to graduate with a chemistry degree and pursue graduate studies in physics? i currently have an interest in working in the areas of renewable energy and materials science after graduation.

291,"can i get some help understanding spacetime and velocity as relating to the 2nd law of thermodynamics?so as i understand it (at least in the minkowski model), we are always moving at the speed of light through spacetime. if you increase your velocity through space, you decrease your velocity through time. because of this, if you move 2 clocks through space, one significantly faster than the other, then when you bring them back together, it turns out that the clock that moved faster is a little behind the other. motion relativity effects between objects moving significantly slower than the speed of light, then, are pretty much just another layer of relativity on top of this. in addition, the speed of light is a universal speed limit. but, theoretically, if you could move faster than light, you'd be reversing causality or going backward in time in some way, or something along those lines. these are my assumptions coming in to this.

anyway, this brings me to my questions.

first, if it's impossible for an ""object"" (you know, like, something that's not a wave/particle with a velocity of c) to actually achieve the speed of light in space, does that mean the same object also can not fully stop moving? there's probably a temptation here to respond by saying ""stop moving relative to what?"" so to clarify, i mean stop moving in the sense that your velocity ""on the space axis"" in the minkowski model is zero. the reason i ask is that if it's impossible to achieve zero on the time axis and c on the space axis, shouldn't it also be impossible to achieve zero on the space axis and c on the time axis? and if it is possible to stop moving on the space axis, why is that? (given that you can't stop moving on the time axis)

then the second question is this: whenever i ask the internet, ""why does time only move forward"" or ""why do objects all move the same direction through time"" or some variation on that question, the answer always seems to be ""because the 2nd law of thermodynamics dictates that the universe must move from a more ordered state to a state of more entropy, therefore you can't unmix a cup of coffee and milk."" but this seems to me to be a truism, or in other words, an answer that doesn't do anything more than describe the question in a different way. it just begs the new question, why does everything move from order to chaos? if we go back to the minkowski model, it would seem that in a universe moving toward a state of total entropy, all objects would simply be reducing their velocity on the space axis and increasing their velocity on the time axis. so i find myself unable to conceptualize any actual relationship between entropy and time at all. is there actually a relationship there i don't understand? or can somebody explain why everything seems to move forward in time without using the 2nd law of thermodynamics as an answer?",1,get help understanding spacetime velocity relating  nd law thermodynamics so understand  at least minkowski model  always moving speed light spacetime  increase velocity space  decrease velocity time  this  move   clocks space  one significantly faster other  bring back together  turns clock moved faster little behind other  motion relativity effects objects moving significantly slower speed light  then  pretty much another layer relativity top this  addition  speed light universal speed limit  but  theoretically  could move faster light  reversing causality going backward time way  something along lines  assumptions coming this  anyway  brings questions  first  impossible  object   you know  like  something that s wave particle velocity c  actually achieve speed light space  mean object also fully stop moving  there s probably temptation respond saying  stop moving relative what  clarify  mean stop moving sense velocity  on space axis  minkowski model zero  reason ask impossible achieve zero time axis c space axis  also impossible achieve zero space axis c time axis  possible stop moving space axis  that   given can t stop moving time axis  second question this  whenever ask internet   why time move forward   why objects move direction time  variation question  answer always seems  because  nd law thermodynamics dictates universe must move ordered state state entropy  therefore can t unmix cup coffee milk  seems truism  words  answer anything describe question different way  begs new question  everything move order chaos  go back minkowski model  would seem universe moving toward state total entropy  objects would simply reducing velocity space axis increasing velocity time axis  find unable conceptualize actual relationship entropy time all  actually relationship understand  somebody explain everything seems move forward time without using  nd law thermodynamics answer

335,"what was the most difficult subject for you during the undergraduate?just out of curiosity.

there are four main subjects when it comes to physics curriculum..

&amp;#x200b;

classical mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics.

&amp;#x200b;

among the four of them i found statistical mechanics(or, equivalently, thermal physics) to be the hardest one. i actually didn't know why i had to derive maxwell's identity, free energy, gibbs free energy, and something else. so many variables that i'm not sure which variable to choose to describe which system. i think it can depend on what textbook is used during the curriculum.

&amp;#x200b;

i used marion and thornton for cm(5th edition) during the second year. i should have grasped thorough knowledge of linear algebra by the time i went through moment of inertia. i didn't know why i had to get eigenvalues of the tensor back then. but this is a clearly a good book cause it helps to connect classical concepts to quantum mechanics and contains a lot of great problems too.

&amp;#x200b;

griffiths for em. it was really helpful to understand how to use vector analysis / calculus. and quite a lot of good problems from the easiest ones to challenging ones. clear explanation. i also found wangsness's em was really great too. i used it as a reference cause griffiths didn't get deep down in certain topics. wangsness basically covers everything to prepare you for jackson.

for context, i'm a theatre student who is working on a performance project. i've been really inspired by mermaids recently (thank you #mermay) and had the fleeting idea of how much of a statement it would be to be wheeled onstage submerged in a large container of water, and then ""gasp"" out, emerging with all the grace of a dying fish. art. but i'm well aware of how impractical that would probably turn out to be in rolling out a container strong enough and large enough to hold me and however much water. still, it was a fun visual.

that did get me curious though. from what i understand, buoyancy helps reduce the amount of force needed to move an object through water. but does that reduction of work matter at all if you're also moving the water?

for instance, say a neutrally-buoyant ball (or is it more fun to imagine a mermaid?) weighs x grams, and a bucket of water weights y grams. ifyou put that ball into the bucket of water and then apply force to the side of the bucket, do you have to apply as much force as it would take to move those two weights, x and y, cuminatively? or does the buoyancy of the ball help reduce the amount of energy needed at all? does the answer change if the ball is more negatively or more positively bouyant?

341,"how do you approach your studies?i suppose this is more of a ""meta"" question rather than a specific physics problem, but i hope it can still have a place here and maybe let me come away with some helpful tips.

i'm having a really hard time studying physics (undergraduate, 4th semester) because it feels so incredibly unrewarding to do so. this issue is not helped by the fact that i do not have any physics related end goal, that physics degree is just going to serve as insurance for a very distant period of my life where i will settle down and my objectives change. for now, i just wish i could do something else. now that i've managed to come this far i should get this thing over the finish line, though.

so that's why i am here. i want to find out how you guys approach studying and how do you set yourself goals that feel achievable and rewarding on a short-term basis? i am currently tackling quantum mechanics and i've never felt so unsatisfied. i chose to study physics because i'm curious about how things work. but at university level that doesn't come easily. when i read a script or book, i understand nothing on the deepest level. in order to truly grasp it in its entirety i would sit for hours on a single page, looking up and understand the concept behind every single word that i didn't know and re-calculating every equation to fully understand the steps from start to finish. and then i finally feel like having a crack at the problem set and realize i get none of it. fantastic! now i don't put in the effort to do this. feeling like an idiot and working hard for an entire day just to maybe at the end of it come out being a tiny step closer to understanding some part of physics sucks really damn hard.

is this really how responsible, hard working students approach their studies? in that case i'm in the wrong place. i mean, in that case it's also kinda cool that i came so far with my pathetic work ethic, but surely there must be ways to make studying feel more meaningful and rewarding on a short-term scale. when i work for an hour my brain goes ""ding! another hour completed, money in the bank."", when i study physics for an hour my brain goes ""what is this crap? oh man, i thought i'm smart. i actually know nothing. knowing anything would require lifetime devotion to the subject. get me out of here!"".

350,"ucsb or uci for undergraduate physics?i just finished my second year as a physics major at a uc and i’ve been accepted to uc irvine and uc santa barbara for physics as a third year transfer. i’m having a tough choice between the two universities and tldr i just feel that academically, ucsb would be the better choice but i would enjoy being at uci more. 

i want to go to grad school when i finish my bachelors at one of these two schools so i know that research opportunity is a big factor when i comes to being a strong applicant. currently i have 0 research experience (yeah i’m behind) but academically i’ve been at the top of my classes (have good relationships with all my physics professors so far  i would say and have asked for letters of rec) and have a 3.8 gpa so i would say if i add in some research experience within these two upcoming years, i would have really good chances of getting into a top school. 
i’m not sure which specific area of physics yet, but i’m hoping i would be certain on one soon.

so i know that ucsb is known to have one of the best physics programs (#2 public university in ca, right behind ucb) so ucsb is pretty respected among the “physics world.” i know that uci has a great physics program as well, but when it comes down to it, does the undergrad university matter? do grad schools take it as a huge factor when considering an applicant? i heard that students in the college of creative studies have high chances of getting into a good grad school because they are well prepped, so i was looking forward to the program. however, i also heard that they don’t care much for transfer students and it’s hard for transfer students to be admitted into ccs. does anybody have more info on this?

i visited both ucsb and uci this week and here’s what i thought of it (please don’t think i’m disrespecting either campus because both are really good campuses and this is just my personal take on it)

when i first got to ucsb, i saw a lot of people walking around and immediately saw the chill vibe of the area. but i don’t like the surrounding college town, isla vista. i’ve heard about how the landlords are super bad and the housing is overpriced for the small space you get. don’t get me wrong, i’m into the party scene but it’s just not a big factor i feel like i need. i’m more into partying with friends rather than huge blowouts with strangers. the reason i don’t like it is because it’s pretty messy and dirty. i like working from home and a clean working space is a high priority to me. i envy the students here who are able to balance everything but i feel that if i try hard enough i can get it done as well. i also feel like the buildings are a bit old but the campus overall is alright. however, the building for the college of creative studies is a run down yellow box and the the building that says physics on it (i think it’s offices and labs for grad students) looks like a jail inside. but other than that, the modern side of the library, the physical science building and the engineering buildings are beautiful. i also know that ucsb has the kavli institute of theoretical physics but as an undergrad does that matter much?(aside from sitting in on seminars from physicists that are here for that resource of course). the side by the lagoon is also beautiful and i really liked it. another thing i liked was that the beach is next to the school so i can see why a lot of people says ucsb is gorgeous. i’m not a big fan of downtown as well. it’s an okay city with some alright food places but i personally love asian cuisine and i didn’t find any great boba or pho/noodle spots (i’m sure there are some outside of goleta).

when i first got to uci i was amazed at how different it is compared to ucsb. it’s almost a complete flip. the nature and beach was swapped for an extremely clean city with not much of a sense of close community like isla vista. i thought the campus itself was also okay but what stood out to me was how close everything is. there’s a little plaza with target, trader joe’s, chick fil a etc. literally next to campus. also the park in the middle of campus seems like a peaceful area (i didn’t like how hilly the inner campus is though). the best thing about going to uci is that one of my close friends who goes there right now is looking for a housemate for a house 10 min walking distance from campus (so i don’t have to worry about housing). i also know a lot of people who go there but i don’t think this is a big deal because college is about making new friends and forming new connections. but i feel that it should be said because that’s why i’m more certain i will have a better time at uci. another big thing is that la and sd is 1-2hrs away + more food areas. the down sides are that the party life, nightlife, and the physics isn’t as strong as compared to ucsb. however my intuition led me to think this: uci is still a research university with a lot of resources related to physics. wouldn’t it be easier to gain research experience here compared to ucsb since not many come to uci for the physics major? idk just a thought, might be wrong.

358,"what is affected by a magnetic field?dear physicians of reddit, i have a little question!

firstly, sorry for my ignorance, i just graduated high-school and my knowledge in physics is limited to the very basic level of a few subjects that i've learned in school.

so i've finished high-school physics about a week ago and one of the subjects were electromagnetism. we learned about the magnetic field, how it's created and how it affects charged particles or any electric current (which is obviously many charged particles, so it makes sense).

i know one definition of a field (electric, magnetic, gravitational,  etc), which is that if you're in the field and you fit a certain requirement (have a mass for gravitational, have a charge for electric, and have a moving charge(?) for magnetic) it applies force on you (we learned newtonian physics so force is a key word).

the thing is, i know that magnetic fields don't only apply force on moving charged particles, as they affect most metals, so what is the requirement for a magnetic field to apply force on you (apart from moving charge)?

i've tried googling this but weirdly didn't find any answers, i'm sure that i just haven't dug far enough, but i'm sure that a personal answer to my question will be the most effective!

382,"i tried to calculate the distance to the alien's homeworld (and the acceleration of their ships) in ""childhood's end"" by arthur c. clarke. did i do this right? if so, how can i get more information?the alien race in childhood's end are called ""the overlords,"" and at various points throughout the book he gives hints regarding their location and technology.  he mentions early on that their ships take ""about an hour"" to reach maximum acceleration,  the overlords ""would age only four months on the round trip [from their planet to earth], but when they returned their friends would be eighty years older.""

so to get the average velocity on the round trip, i would need:

t = t0 / (sqrt (1 - (v/c)^2))

4 months = 1.051 *10^7 seconds.
80 years = 2.523 * 10^9 seconds.

solve for v:

2.523 * 10^9 seconds = 1.051 *10^7 seconds / (sqrt (1-(v/c)^2)

(1.051 *10^7 seconds/ 2.523 * 10^9 seconds)^2 = 1 - (v/c)^2

1.735*10^(-5) + (v/c)^2 = 1

(v/c) = sqrt (1-1.735*10^(-5) ) = 0.999991325

v = (0.99999132496) * (299 792 458 m / s) = 299,789,857 m/s average velocity.

299,789,857 m/s  * (80 years in seconds) = 7.585*10^17 meters = 80.17 light years (round trip)

hence, the overlords' planet is ~40.085 light years away (supposedly in the constellation carina).


it supposedly took the overlords ""about an hour"" to accelerate their ships to these speeds (g-force compensators were mentioned).  the simple way to do this would simply be to divide the speed of light by an hour and call that a rough approximation of the acceleration.

however, the ""about an hour"" figure comes from the time measured *on the spaceship*.  up until this point, this was all stuff i learned in high school and i'm a bit rusty.  but i genuinely don't know how to determine how long it took them to accelerate from the perspective on a stationary observer.

386,"water from the air concept – plausible?here’s an idea i had:

consider how a rocket stove works..

there is an inlet where wood is fed into the stove and an outlet for which the exhaust can vent. very simple but very effective.

now apply that idea toward a water collection device: 

instead of using fire and wood use a heating element or alternatively you could use a fresnel lense heating a metal surface with focused concentrated sunlight.

the hot air would rise out the outlet of the stove and i believe this would draw in air into the inlet of the stove. not sure whether a constriction at the top of the outlet would be ideal to create a pressurized release of heated air that may draw in even more air into the inlet or whether that would lessen the ability.

zeolite rocks could be placed into where the wood would normally be stacked such that the air would be drawn through the porous material. this would cause the water to bead up and accumulate. you could make a drip pan to divert the water off into a container at that point. 

so my question is:

with wood burning stoves and rocket stoves, there is a lot of air drawn into the stove and often in a lot of airflow (several cfm.) 

is this condition possible to recreate absent consumables? could just heating the air make this possible? i know that smoke and the various release of different hydrocarbons have more mass then air alone so that would create more of a draft. also when fire burns it consumes the oxygen in the air. 

the ideal condition is to have a high rate of airflow going through the device so that water in the air will accumulate in the zeolite and be harvested. with heating air alone in the above described arrangement (absent consumables) is this possible to create a high rate of airflow?",1,water air concept   plausible here s idea had  consider rocket stove works  inlet wood fed stove outlet exhaust vent  simple effective  apply idea toward water collection device  instead using fire wood use heating element alternatively could use fresnel lense heating metal surface focused concentrated sunlight  hot air would rise outlet stove believe would draw air inlet stove  sure whether constriction top outlet would ideal create pressurized release heated air may draw even air inlet whether would lessen ability  zeolite rocks could placed wood would normally stacked air would drawn porous material  would cause water bead accumulate  could make drip pan divert water container point  question is  wood burning stoves rocket stoves  lot air drawn stove often lot airflow  several cfm  condition possible recreate absent consumables  could heating air make possible  know smoke various release different hydrocarbons mass air alone would create draft  also fire burns consumes oxygen air  ideal condition high rate airflow going device water air accumulate zeolite harvested  heating air alone described arrangement  absent consumables  possible create high rate airflow

389,"simple circular motion exerciseso i'm pretty sure i know what to do, but the book tells me i'm wrong. it goes as follows: ""when you throw a marble on a circular track with a 80 cm (0.80 m) radius, the module of its centripetal acceleration is 2 m/s\^2. it takes 4 seconds for the marble to do one rotation. how many more rotations will it do before stopping?"" (roughly translated from french).

&amp;#x200b;

first, i found the initial speed of the marble with a = v\^2/r, so speed = sqrt(a\*r), so sqrt(2\*0,8), which is roughly 1,265. then, i found the speed after one rotation with 2\*pi\*r / period, so 2\*pi\*0.8/4, which is roughly 1.257 m/s.

&amp;#x200b;

with this, i found the acceleration between the two with final speed\^2 = initial speed\^2 + 2\*a\*x. replacing x with 2\*pi\*0.8 and the respective speeds with the ones found above, i got an acceleration of  around -0.0021. with the same equation but this time with 0 as final speed, 1,257 as initial speed and the acceleration i found, i got 380.46 meters, so divided by 2\*pi\*0.8 i get 75.69 rotations.

422,"question concerning a (hydrogen/oxygen) fuel cell/ electrolytic cell setup.hopefully quick question: if i connect a fuel cell to an electrolytic cell, placing the fuel cell above the electrolytic cell, and decide to convert some of the potential energy of the water into electricity as it flows down (back into the electrolytic cell) (with, say, a turbine(s) ), the later should scale with the height difference between the two, right?

i'm certain it's impossible to just ""build higher"" until achieving a net gain (as far as the in/output of electrical energy is concerned), but i don't know enough about the related processes to be able to tell why, and that's been bugging me. (honestly i'm not sure even sure if this is more of a chemistry question....)

specifically: can the setup theoretically be freely scaled in height, if no, why, and if yes, which of the processes lose(s) in efficiency/ unit mass to compensate for the increased yield of the turbine?

423,"rg flows: callan-simanzyk vs. wilsonsay i got myself my favourite qft in d dim. i can do two things: 1, compute loop diagrams like there is no tomorrow, regularize, renormalize (say dim-reg + ms bar), and i find my beta functions “a la c-s”. or 2, write the path integral, coarse-grain integrating out momentum shells, and find my beta functions “a la w”. in both cases i’m looking at how the couplings change with the energy scale, so they should give the same thing, morally speaking.

here come the questions:

- are they really the same thing? i seem to recall from the back of my mind that there was some issue with massless fields, but i cannot find where i read it, or any place where they discuss these things for that matter.

- does scheme dependence play a role in the story?

- in particular, take qed in 2+1d. all 1pi diagrams are finite, which would mean that the beta functions are zero “a la c-s”, but they definitely are not “a la w”. it confuses me.

425,"designing a game level around 4th dimension. are my ideas theoretically valid?hello, as the title says i'm designing a small map themed around the 4th dimension. there sure will be some scifi mixed in but i'd like to validate my ideas before i proceed to create something that defies the real world physics (or theoretical) completely.


so basically the idea is that humanity discovered this weird area in the universe where higher dimensional objects interrupt with our 3d universe (oddly enough it's only a local phenomena). people studied it and figured out how to ""stabilize"" these objects and built some kind of a 4th dimensional museum/entertainment park around it - that's the map i'm creating.


the way i think about it is with the 2d creature living in flatland analogy. you could crush it/obstruct its' world from your 3d world right? i wanna do kind of the same with the 4th dimension. there's also another part which says 4th dimension is time. i can crudely imagine both explanations separately but they don't quite come together for me. however i'd like to use them both.


the ideas:
i wanna have areas which are ""stabilized"" (safe for 3d creature to explore) and then unstable areas where objects would be popping in and out randomly and could kill you. 
	
* in safe areas, 4d objects could only be observed visually - have no collision or their collision would be locked in place in 3d
	
* tessaract - i wanted to throw the player inside a (hollow) hypercube but i'm unsure if that even makes sense. basically you would go inside all 6 (8?) of the cubes in tessaracts' 3d projection and then maybe teleport in another projection of it since that's about everything i could think of. is that reasonable?
	
* in unstable areas there would be randomly killing 4d objects or a moving timescale where things would go back and forth in time under your legs. xyz coordinates would stay the same for you, only the time axis would change so you would see objects in the room moving around in time. this would probably be only a visual thing, done by holograms and animations but theoretically if you move yourself on a timescale to a point where there's a collision in your xyz at the time, you die right?
	
* at the end you would get sucked into a black hole but i have yet to figure that part out

	
do these ideas make at least a little bit of sense or does it go against physics too much?
are there any other interesting 4d ideas i could throw in?

427,"physics revolving airplanesi have two questions. and this only regards newton’s 3 laws and the forces of lift(fn), thrust(fa), weight(fg), and drag(ff).

i) to takeoff, an airplane must accelerate until its forward speed gives it enough lift to get of the the ground. what are two ways in which the mass of the airplane affects takeoff?

my answer: the weight of the aircraft affects the lift and the drag of the aircraft. more weight means more thrust needed to accelerate and the force of lift would need to be greater than that of the weight in order for it to properly takeoff.

ii) why is friction greater at lower altitudes?

my answer: friction is greater at lower altitudes because the air is more dense than that of being at higher altitudes

 what im wondering is there a way to solve for the sunset over a mountain of known height and distance away? such as in my (shitty) ms paint drawing:  my question is, if you know the height of the mountain, and the height of the observer, and the distance between them, and the angle formed from the sunsets, is it possible to work out a solution to the radius of the earth?

i ask because currently in my lab class i am trying to measure the radius of the earth using sunrise and sunset, and both of those have mountains in the way that are seriously affecting our data.

assumptions you can make:

the distance between the observer and the mountain is essentially just d, and flat, that is to say you can assume that there is no curvature between them (if this helps). 

the mountain is in the range of 5-10 times the height of the observer,  so it doesn't form a near rectangle or anything.

i just rinsed a beer bottle and put it on my drying rack for recycling. it got me wondering if there's a best angle to place something like that for maximum drying efficiency.

straight up is obviously wrong as gravity would counteract the effects of evaporation, but straight down seems like it would lose the benefits of having water gather together and be more prone to exit the bottle.

498,"maximum stress withstood by a grid fin during reentryhello reddit. i'm currently doing a paper on the materials that can be used to make grid fins but first i have to find what are the stresses that they will have to withstand. i've been searching for a couple of days but i haven't found anything certain. i have tried framing it as a load and sheer force problem but i haven't got any experience in that so i've found it difficult to calculate anything. the data that i have collected is the following:

* the maximum acceleration that the craft experiences is 5.6 g.
* the dimensions of the fin are 1.22 (width) by 1.524 (length) by 0.22 (height) meters.
* the total mass of the rocket (falcon heavy centerstage) is 424.6 tonnes, however, the burned fuel changes this to around 30 tonnes.
* at this point, the aerodynamic pressure is of 2.6 kn/m\^2
* the mass of the fin is 100 kg (not totally sure).
* the diameter of the stage is 3.7 meters (this makes the total cross section cutting right through the fins 3.7+1.524\*2=6.748)

feel free to make any simplifications that you want, i only need a rough estimate of the stresses that the craft withstand. but i have only gotten values of either 2 or so mpa (too low to be true, since the aluminum fins suffered a lot and they have around 400 mpa of tensile strength) or 5000 mpa (the titanium fins currently in use wouldn't withstand this load).

light of 430nm wavelength shines on metal plate. the necessary voltage to stop the escaping electrons is .79v. 
if the wavelength is put at 400nm, 1v is needed to stop the electrons. 

a) what value of plancks konstant(h) does these measurements give? 

b) what value for the wavelength threshold(f0) does these measurements result in?

i used the 4 given values to create a equations system where i could calculate f0, based on the equation e=eu + ek(h*f = h*f0 + ((mv^2)/(2)).

part b)

...... using y\_0 = 0 from beginning of function and v = 0 at the top of the function

y = ( y\_0 ) + ( v ) \* ( t ) + 1/2 ( a ) ( t \^2)

y = ( 0 ) + ( 0 ) \* ( 2.9 ) + 1/2 ( -9.81 ) ( 2.9\^2 )

y = 1/2 ( -9.81 ) ( 2.9 \^2)

y = 41.209 m

&amp;#x200b;

part c)

y = ( y\_0 ) + ( v ) \* ( t ) + 1/2 ( a ) ( t \^2)

( 13.9 ) = ( 41.209 ) + ( v ) \* ( 2.9 ) + 1/2 ( -9.81 ) ( 2.9 )

( -27.309 ) = ( 2.9 \* v ) + ( 41.209 )

( -68.518 ) = ( 2.9 \* v )

v = -23.627 m/s

we hear all the time about how processors are running into problems keeping up with moore's law and dealing with quantum interference. however, my understanding is that this is mostly due to limits of silicon, not due to a fundamental physical limit.

as an example, i understand graphine is much faster than silicon (i saw something about possibilities of a terahertz). superconductivity and/or photonic chips could also make a big difference.

i also know that there's ways to leverage the 'quantum interference' for different types of computation (aka quantum computers).

i've done some googling on this and saw some stuff on black hole computers, but i'm not sure how practical that would be. i would think that even a small amount of black hole material would either slow down the processing speed due to relativistic effects... or it would not be able to stay compressed and explode.

i would also think there would be a thermodynamic limit component as well.

here are the rules:

the device must be activated either while floating within the top 6 inches of water or while being held just above the surface of the water 

it must then retrieve a gold ball from the bottom; everything (device and ball) must end up floating within the top 6 inches of the water in the container. (the ball itself does not need to break the surface of the water as long as it is held by the device within the top 6 inches of the water) 

you may only interact with your device once to activate it in the beginning. after that the device must operate on its own. 

the device may not damage the container. 

the device must be self contained. it may not alter the characteristics of the water in the container by dumping sand, chemicals, salt, etc. 

you may not use any live animals as part of your device (lol).

this is the point where i don't understand why from there on, different models like fowkes or owens &amp; wendt exist, which devide the surface tension into components. the young-dupré equation combined with the rule of geometric already has only one unknown variable left: the solid's surface tension/free energy. so you would just have to measure the contact angle and the liquid's surface tension and could calculate the surface free energy.

 it has been suggested that a possible transportation system to connect two cities such as boston and washington, d.c., might function like this: drill a tunnel straight from boston to washington. a car released in boston would fall under the influence of gravity, gaining speed, and then finally coasting back to the surface at washington. the only expenditure of energy required would be that to overcome friction, and this could be reduced by using an evacuated tunnel or magnetic levitation of the train or other possible techniques. assuming the density of the earth is constant (it isn't), and using only the value of the acceleration of gravity at the earth's surface (9.8 m/s2) and the radius of the earth (6380 km) determine how long it would take to travel between any two cities via a straight tunnel. the result, rather surprisingly, is about:

569,"energy changes in a dielectricdear all,

&amp;#x200b;

quick question about dielectrics. say you have charged up your capacitor, with a dielectric inside it, and then disconnected it from the power supply. so by q = vc, as the capacitance decreases but the charge stays the same, the voltage increases. so c decreases, v increases. then, looking at equations for energy, e = 1/2qv so if voltage increases then the energy increases, and likewise if e = 1/2q\^2/c, if c decreases then energy increases. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm asked to explain why the energy increases once the dielectric is removed. i would have gone straight to use of equations, however, the mark scheme writes:

&amp;#x200b;

energy increases because: in the polar dielectric molecules align in the field with positive charged end toward the negative plate

work is done on the capacitor separating the positively charged surface of the dielectric from the negatively charged plate (or vice versa).

# tldr

trying to use water to store some heat during afternoon and release it at night (or more functionally store cold at night and release it during afternoon).

# background/reason

i feel like i am overlooking something major. the thermostat is custom code on an omega 2+ which logs multiple temps including outside from the open weather map api. code is not a simple is temp above/below value =&gt; turn on/off-it looks at stuff like has the ac been running long enough that cooling limit has been reached for this cycle.

being south texas and an older house and upstairs, the hot afternoon has been a struggle even with upstairs having a separate ac unit. to help combat this, precooling happens from like 5am to 10am, but this means it gets up to 3.25 degrees colder during that part just to not be 80+ inside mid afternoon.

i had read an article one time about a company that was making ac systems affordable enough for use in houses that freeze a block of ice at night and use it to cool the house during the heat/peak hours (can't find that article again). one day i thought why not make a hybrid form where it is thermal mass in the air return to (more or less) ""release heat at night and absorb it during the day"" which would help the ac unit.

&amp;#x200b;

# setup

been trying to figure out a way to use thermal mass to help in some way, but didn't want to lug a bunch of cinder blocks upstairs. realized water and copper pipe is my answer. this is still early phase testing/prototyping, which is why it is just 20 feet coiled 1/2 inch copper and no fins, 12 gallon cooler, holes in lid not sealed, and why the coil is not centered (first iteration it was mounted to cooler lid, but that made things difficult to work with). pump is a 300 gph pump. started with 5 gallons of distilled water.

[ early results

this is the last week of data. installing it didn't change behavior, but turning the pump on did stabilize the temp, kinda since it seemed to just not let it get as cool while the upper limit didn't really change. then tried some experiments where added frozen gallons jugs of water which quickly cooled the water down but didn't seem to affect the air. at some point in there i reduced the water to just under 3 gallons (just before the pump started pulling in bubbles), but again no change.

[ is the past day for a better look (with low/high cutoff hidden since the temp is high enough to not interact with them right now). the pump was off the whole time except for the short bit where the water temp went up. this time i had the flow rate of the pump as low as it would go, which was still a large flow of water and a long/high enough length of tube/pipe/resistance that i had to start the flow with it at a higher rate then turn it down.

[ hour data range for a closer look at when the pump was turned on. data points are 1 minute intervals in all the graphs.

[ \~2/3 of this overlap with the previous image, but better screenshot and the following \~40 minutes

[ expectations/help

my expectations going in to this was that in this configuration it would have a small impact, but be a proof of concept so v2 can do more. figured when the air is cooling down it would be a little slower to cool, but when it was warming up it would resist warming up some too as the copper/water absorb/release heat. water flow rate could be used to adjust the impact it had a little bit (or thermostat controls times when pump is on/off).

i'm running out of ideas as to what the problem could be. the only other thing i can think of is if it doesn't have enough water. but a possible error that i am going to test tonight and add the results of is if the pump itself is heating the water up, to test will disconnect the tube from pump and turn it on to see if it makes the same heating curve in water temperature.

&amp;#x200b;

story is: i studied nuclear engineering about six years ago, but left in my senior year due to health and financial issues (was studying in the us but had come from the eu).

&amp;#x200b;

during my senior year i had an idea for an experiment that had to do with the potential of saving a considerable amount of energy in the ignition of a fusion reaction (tokomak confined) and presented it to two of my professors who assured me that the math is correct and told me that indeed the idea had promise and that i should pursue it for my masters-phd. as mentioned, getting that far is not an option for me (mainly due to finances) and i was wondering if there would be a way to pursue the experiment otherwise.

&amp;#x200b;

having sent to a couple of research centers where i live, i had my idea turned down without said centers reading the written experiment proposal, as i lack the level of degree to make a proper application - which is understandable. i really don't know how i should move forward with this, or if there is anything i can do about it, but i do indeed feel it is a waste.

&amp;#x200b;

anyways thanks for reading through, and please do let me know if i should post this question elsewhere or any other recommendations you may have. also, do you think it would be safe to post the actual experiment proposal here?

&amp;#x200b;

why might there be a non-negligible difference? well, figuring out the motion of the planets in our solar system is an n-body problem. so that motion is supposed to be chaotic - highly sensitive to changes in initial conditions. at least, on a timescale of [5 million years]( the positions of planets should be highly sensitive to conditions now. but just how sensitive is an n-body system to \*tiny\* perturbations in the gravitational field?

&amp;#x200b;

now, these questions might seem a bit dumb since my knowledge has tons of holes so please bear with me.

&amp;#x200b;

there is no difference between visible wavelenghts and others (&gt; or &lt;) but only the ones in the visible spectrum can be picked up by our eyes - is this right so far?

&amp;#x200b;

is the hue/color we associate with these wavelenghts defined by the brain alone?

&amp;#x200b;

if you were to have ""special eyes"" that also are larger than ours, could they possibly see wavelenghts that are larger than visible light? lets say up to microwaves.

example a and b are the same lever.

a lever with side l (3m long) has 10 n while side x(1m long) has 25 n of force. to balance the lever side l need only 8.33 n. so there is a surplus on side l of 1.67 n

question: on point b when lever on side x is at a 45 degree angle then comes down on side l with 1.67 n of force until it becomes level to the ground( lever becomes parallel to the ground)
if the 10n on side l as it's coming down becomes level to the ground, at the point where the lever is parallel to ground and the 10n is suddenly removed as the downward momentum is in play, 

will the downward momentum have enough kinetic energy to keep lifting side x with the 25n once 10n is removed on side l?

or regardless of the downward momentum,  once the 10n is removed will side x instantly begin to move down? 

i hope this is clear but it is kind of complicated for me to explain. i'm thinking once the moment of side l comes down from a distance,  once the 10n are instantly removed when it becomes parallel to the ground it will still have enough momentum to keep lifting the 25n for a foot or so before side x with 25n comes crashing down.

630,"data/signal processing: which method to use to find the frequency?for a reaserch project, we had to study swimming particles.  depending on the initial conditions and varying parameters, we observed a huge difference in the behaviour of those swimmers. now, the goal is to quantify our observations.

&amp;#x200b;

the particles (w=0.5 mm, l=1 mm) are spinning with an angular velocity that we increment by changing our settings and depending on the spin of each particle, the group swims at a different speed. 

we recorded everything on the lab camera and processed each video resulting in a huge amount of data such as coordinates and angle with the x axis of each particle. 

&amp;#x200b;

when trying to analyse the angular velocity, we encountered a few problems. 

one of them (comes from the image processing) was that the range of the angle is \[0,180\]. at a very low frequency, the particles align with the x axis, in such a way that a small perturbation results in an angle rapidly switching between a huge value (\~180°) and a very small value (\~0°). we were able to overcome this problem by considering the sinus of the angle. 

the result is a sinusiodal signal whose frequency should give us the angular velocity right? 

&amp;#x200b;

my main question is the following:

**how can i get that frequency from a list of numbers?** 

i tried to use the fft function (working with numpy) but it doesn't seem to work well, perhaps because of the noise. it seems like there are too much methods to smooth the signal and i don't really have the time to go through precise documentation to pick the right one.

631,"voltage drop, ac, and dcone of the reasons we use ac to transmit power is because it looses less power over longer distances. but the way i understand it, ac should actually loose more power than dc.  here is why. 

intuitively i can imagine electrons in a wire like a long string of balls connected by springs, to simulate there repulsive forces, i believe in thermodynamics something similar is done. 

power is lost because when you push on one end x distance, since the force has to travel across so many springs friction causes some of that force to be absorbed in the compression so that the ball at the end will move &lt;x.  so if you vibrate the first ball in the chain, if the wire is long enough the ball at the end may not even move at all,  in this way i imagine ac current will diminish in a very long wire. 

&amp;#x200b;

but for dc current, when you compress the first ball and continue to push, once the chain reaches its max compression the current would then flow without relativity any more loss, in other words you only have the initial loss of power to get every movement, the opposite would be pulling a loose chain until it is taut, all the pulling until it is taut is doing no work but then the chain is good, as opposed to pulling the chain then pushing it back before it reaches taut, which would be the ac analog.

i was trying to better understand what kind of trajectory through phase space such a system would take as we extract work from it. ie, if we start at a particular thermodynamic state (n, t, s, p, v, u) with non-zero helmholtz free-energy, and start isothermally isochorically extracting work until the helmholtz free-energy is zero, does that define a *unique path* between those two points in phase space? are there non-unique possible termini at which the helmholtz free energy is zero?

any thoughts appreciated.

643,"physics question i spent 3 whole days on still cant answer.if anyone could help me out with this it will be massively appreciated! (doesn't even need to be an answer just a little help to get me in the right direction i guess) i searched all over the net and cant figure out how to answer this.

&amp;#x200b;

i am given the position, velocity and mass, of two colliding balls in a simulation.

simulation here: [ (under the advanced tab)

&amp;#x200b;

my job is to add a third ball and give it a velocity, and a position (must use a mass of 1kg) so that the momentum of all three colliding balls add up to zero, in addition to this, they must collide simultaneously in an effort to get them all to stick. (also the collision is 0% elastic).

&amp;#x200b;

i believe i have been able to figure out the velocity of the 3rd ball, using the conservation of momentum. (split into the x and y direction) like this:

m before=m after

m1+m2+m3=0

m1+m2=(-m3)

&amp;#x200b;

so my answers for the 3rd balls velocity:

0.6m/s in the y direction

0.25 in the x direction

645,"this table is made of particles...which are excitations in fieldshello learned physicists.  i have a relatively simple question about matter to which i hope a simple answer is possible. 

i understand a small bit about particle physics and field theory in that i read pop science books and articles and find it all fascinating to think about (without ever really grasping the mathematics behind it all).  nowadays it seems to me that matter is best described as quantum excitations in fields, so higgs, electromagnetic etc. 

i am sitting at a table here, and the table is made of wood, which is made of different molecules, which themselves are made of different atoms comprising of electrons, protons (made of quarks) and neutrons (also formed of quarks) which are all quantum excitations in their fields.  you could say they are particles outstanding in their fields? little joke there

so these particles, i presume, don’t actually sustain over the lifetime of the table, or even from moment to moment? if i could somehow identify the particles (which i think is impossible due to the uncertainty principle) would we see that the particles are constantly changing, flashing in and out of existence, but their fields remain, which is what gives the perception of concreteness?  and as the years pass, and the elements break down the table, attrition of particles in the air, rain, whatever else, constantly coming up against those of the table see the table being broken down and dissolved.  is that correct?

what i’m asking, i suppose, is that from moment to moment, are the particles which make up something solid, actually in flux constantly and at an imperceptible fast speed, or are the particles sort of there, frozen, and remain there until its broken down and changed into something else

or maybe i’m totally off

649,"does the rise of electric charge the u(1) symmtry group and the ""complexity"" of the field entail special properties of the em interaction and charge?okay, so when we impose phase invariance ( u(1) ) on a field we get through noether's theorem the conservation of electric charge and consequently em. but we only get a charge if the field we're dealing with is complex(?), if we try to apply it to (for example) a real scalar field we get no charge. now i interpreted this (and my prof) as the real field doesn't interact through em, which is fine, but the question i always had was, what is the relation between the ""complexity"" of the field and charge? 

to answer this question, i went through the following reasoning; now let's forget about ""complexity"" as it's in essence just a neat mathematical trick to deal with 2-element vectors ( or is it ?? ) so we represent out complex field as a (real) vector field with 2-elements.

and now i cut the question intro smaller questions: 

+ if this is just a mathematical edifice, can we reformulate the mathematical framework so that the 2-element vector field becomes a real scalar field and keep the electric charge property ( u(1) will change as well)? 

+ do we lose the charge information by doing this? 

+ if not then what else do we lose?

+ if yes, then what is so special about electric charge that we need the extra ""degree of freedom""? 

+ and consequently what does this tell us about the em interaction and it's need for that ""degree of freedom""?

• less frequent collisions mean less average force is exerted on the container walls, since p=f/a pressure decreases

725,"what are the effects of assumptions and interpretation on understanding quantum mechanics?i often wonder how much of the strangeness of quantum mechanics results from the underlying assumptions in developing quantum mechanics as well as how the results of quantum mechanics are interpreted.  

for example, how does quantum mechanics treat particles and space, and what sort of assumptions do we have to make in order to formalize our treatment of particles and space?  does interpretation of something like the uncertainly principal require impose additional assumptions?

most articles and books written for the lay person proceed as if particles are 0-dimensional points, space is built up as a continuous division of points, and the uncertainty principal imposes limits on what we can know through measurement.  in doing so, we are assuming space is a continuous object, there are particles in space that occupy a single point, and once measured, a particle has a well defined location even if we cannot entirely know that location.  

however, i think that if one changes the background assumptions, the understanding of what happens above changes.  (i don't think these are great examples nor do i believe them - they're just easy to think about and thus a useful starting point.)  if we still assume space is continuous but particles had some size and shape which is able to move in a non-uniform manner (different parts moving in different speeds or directions), our inability to measure its position could be related to how we try and collapse this into a single positional value.  or, what if particles are just bigger than what we would expect and in doing a measurement, we are only seeing a given piece a particle?",1,effects assumptions interpretation understanding quantum mechanics i often wonder much strangeness quantum mechanics results underlying assumptions developing quantum mechanics well results quantum mechanics interpreted  example  quantum mechanics treat particles space  sort assumptions make order formalize treatment particles space  interpretation something like uncertainly principal require impose additional assumptions  articles books written lay person proceed particles   dimensional points  space built continuous division points  uncertainty principal imposes limits know measurement  so  assuming space continuous object  particles space occupy single point  measured  particle well defined location even cannot entirely know location  however  think one changes background assumptions  understanding happens changes   i think great examples believe   they re easy think thus useful starting point  still assume space continuous particles size shape able move non uniform manner  different parts moving different speeds directions  inability measure position could related try collapse single positional value  or  particles bigger would expect measurement  seeing given piece particle

735,"rotating an object by applying forcehello,

i have a question about how to use ""thrusters"" to rotate a landing module. for simplicity, it is all in 2d, the red arrows are the direction of the thrusters when they fire and it is upright, yellow is the rotation axis.

i have an inital rotation of the ship thetha, and i want to figure out how much thrust i have to apply on what thruster to rotate it back so the rotation of it is correct again (aka. no rotation). all thrusters always fire orthogonal to the surface they are mounted to.

what i know is (i) the mass of the object, (ii) distance from the thrusters to the axis, and (iii) how much force each thruster can apply in newtons.

&amp;#x200b;

i wonder how i can go from those pieces of information to a change in angular velocity? or in other words, how i know how many degrees/radians i have turned if i have fired a thruster for *n* seconds with a force of *f* newtons.

&amp;#x200b;

to solve this problem, i have looked at the formula for torque which seems to be ""t=f\*r\*sin(theta)"". f is the force, r the distance from the axis, and theta is the angle at which the force is applied. in my example, if i would move up the thrusters slightly, this should always be pi/2 because the thrust vector is orthogonal to the surface, so i can simplify to ""t=f\*r"". if i say that i apply 300n and the thruster is 2m away, i apply 600\[nm\] of force but know i am stuck, and i have no idea how to calculate the change in angle if i apply this force for n seconds.

738,"expanding on the rubber sheet analogyhello. not long ago i took part in a discussion about general relativity and the well-known rubber sheet analogy, and it made me realize there was a gap in my understanding of it. i went looking for answers and i believe i managed to fill the gap, but i'd like to hear a confirmation that my current understanding is on the right track.

the rubber sheet is a great tool to understand how gravity can affect photons even though they don't have any mass - while they are always moving in a straight line, this straight line can appear curved without taking the effect of gravity into account. it *seems* to explain attraction of two bodies (a marble will fall into the ""well"" created by the more massive object on the rubber sheet), but that explanation itself requires gravity to work, so that's not really helpful.

this is the gap i was talking about. i understood that mass warps space around it, causing straight lines in its vicinity to appear curved. in addition it causes objects with mass to attract one another. i realized i view these two effects as separate and my original understanding couldn't explain how both of those effects could be explained by a single cause.

looking for answers, i realized that the rubber sheet analogy fails mainly because it only shows us the effect of gravity on space rather than spacetime. so what i did was to imagine a model that takes time into account. normally the two dimensional sheet represents our three spacial dimensions, but to be able to fit in time as well, we'll have to further reduce our three dimensional space to just a line, with the other dimension of the sheet representing time.

an object staying in place would keep its spacial coordinate the same while the temporal coordinate would steadily increase as the time passes, effectively moving in a straight line. however, if there's another massive object, the sheet gets warped same as in the original analogy and the straight line representing the object ""staying in the same place"" gets curved towards the massive object, which in effect translates into the attraction.

so what gravity does is that it curves the ""future"" of nearby objects towards its centre, meaning they will be closer in the future, which means that they accelerate towards it.

is this somewhat correct? can this model more faithfully represent how gravity works? are there any obvious problems or shortcomings?",1,expanding rubber sheet analogyhello  long ago took part discussion general relativity well known rubber sheet analogy  made realize gap understanding it  went looking answers believe managed fill gap  i d like hear confirmation current understanding right track  rubber sheet great tool understand gravity affect photons even though mass   always moving straight line  straight line appear curved without taking effect gravity account   seems  explain attraction two bodies  a marble fall  well  created massive object rubber sheet  explanation requires gravity work  that s really helpful  gap talking about  understood mass warps space around it  causing straight lines vicinity appear curved  addition causes objects mass attract one another  realized view two effects separate original understanding explain effects could explained single cause  looking answers  realized rubber sheet analogy fails mainly shows us effect gravity space rather spacetime  imagine model takes time account  normally two dimensional sheet represents three spacial dimensions  able fit time well  we ll reduce three dimensional space line  dimension sheet representing time  object staying place would keep spacial coordinate temporal coordinate would steadily increase time passes  effectively moving straight line  however  there s another massive object  sheet gets warped original analogy straight line representing object  staying place  gets curved towards massive object  effect translates attraction  gravity curves  future  nearby objects towards centre  meaning closer future  means accelerate towards it  somewhat correct  model faithfully represent gravity works  obvious problems shortcomings

764,"black hole questions. particle field interactions.     i love to learn new mind boggling things but i've never taken a physics class before. i haven't done any serious math in a long time. as such most of my knowledge is just a cheap simulation that let's be roughly piece ideas together.
     that being said i should start off that the vector nature of velocity confuses me. it makes sense when i think of straight lines or trying to stop something. even an ellipse makes i can follow but if you are in a perfectly circular orbit what is supposed to be meant by there being acceleration despite your distance and speed being constant? is energy still being transferred between the object and the gravitational field?
      if you're still here i promise i'm getting to the black holes now. well quasars actually? so i wanted to understand where synchrotron radiation comes from and why it's emitted as radiowaves. electrons are swept up and interact with a magnetic field. this changes their velocity but is this only in direction? is the speed changed? this seems to be the field giving a nudge to the particle so why is light emitted? is it simply because it's speed hadn't increased? can this type of light be emitted at other frequencies as well?
     does this field come from the plasma in the accretion disk? were these electrons deeper than the disk itself? why does the disk emit x ray light but the electrons only produce low energy radio waves? 
     my final question is if gravity pulls only towards the center of mass then how do objects initially headed towards the black hole somehow get ejected. i know photons can escape if they are emitted outward (before the event horizon) but they get redshifted. how do particles escape at high speeds when they got most of that energy falling into they field? also if the accretion disk was the equator why do the radiation jets get released at the poles? is that gravity or another field?",1,black hole questions  particle field interactions  love learn new mind boggling things i ve never taken physics class before  done serious math long time  knowledge cheap simulation let s roughly piece ideas together  said start vector nature velocity confuses me  makes sense think straight lines trying stop something  even ellipse makes follow perfectly circular orbit supposed meant acceleration despite distance speed constant  energy still transferred object gravitational field  still promise i m getting black holes now  well quasars actually  wanted understand synchrotron radiation comes emitted radiowaves  electrons swept interact magnetic field  changes velocity direction  speed changed  seems field giving nudge particle light emitted  simply speed increased  type light emitted frequencies well  field come plasma accretion disk  electrons deeper disk itself  disk emit x ray light electrons produce low energy radio waves  final question gravity pulls towards center mass objects initially headed towards black hole somehow get ejected  know photons escape emitted outward  before event horizon  get redshifted  particles escape high speeds got energy falling field  also accretion disk equator radiation jets get released poles  gravity another field

766,"this is out of curiosityok so a few days ago i was climbing a big rope(you know the 30-40 cm diameter ones that you put on the roof and climb them during pe? yeah that one) without anything to keep me safe(i knew it was a stupid idea but i just went with it anyway) and i managed to tear my skin on two places while falling back down - one a bit worse than the other and i also felt quite a beat of heat afterwards. so i got curious. how much force was exerted onto my hands and why didn't my entire hand get its skin ripped apart and instead only on two places i got hurt. i asked my physics teacher to help me out but sadly she is always really busy with projects and other stuff so she just took a quick glance at this and told me that it's going to be a very tedious thing to calculate. after a bit of counting, i could count about 40 points on my hands where they touch the rope and when i told her about it she said the easiest way to calculate this would be to assume that all of them are the same size and are under the same amount of force. 

&amp;#x200b;

obviously, no exact calculations can be made unless there is a 3d scan of how i hold the rope so for simplicity's sake let's assume that i held the rope with both of my hands at about 40 points of contact. let's also say that each point of contact is a circle with a diameter of 1 cm. considering clothes and boots let's say i weigh about 90 kilograms. the skin on my hands is a bit thicker than a normal person's because in my spare time i go climbing. i am about 190 cms tall and i made  6 steps up from about my waistline to standing upright so let's assume i fell about 4 meters. the fall itself wasn't all that fast i would say about 1m/s but my hands felt quite hot after it. if i were to guess they were probably about 30-40 degrees celsius and took like 2-3 minutes to cool off. the rope itself wasn't all that rough. can't say i have used a lot of ropes in my life but let's assume it's a standard roughness one. and i think that's everything needed to set things in motion.

&amp;#x200b;

up until now, i have been playing around with simple forces. like two cubes attached together with a string that can be neither compressed nor moved(so basically a pillar with no weight) being pulled or pushed at different angles and having to solve the force that is applied to them, so i have no idea what to do with the 40 points of contact that are on an imperfect object like a hand. i don't even know if they matter or not like for me it sounds logical that you can't just lump them in as one thing that has a force applied on it but for all i know my intuition might be wrong. so any ways i can pull this off with the minimal amount of effort and the highest possible amount of accuracy?

&amp;#x200b;

as an 11th grader that thinks he is finally leaning the stuff needed to start solving problems from real life, it sounds like i'm an awful student. what even is the point of studying physics if i cannot even solve simple problems like these?

but what if a truly massive wave hit us, what would we see or feel? does not matter how large, just need to visualize it somehow... even if we are talking about a wave that would need more energy than there is in the known universe... 

if i understand correctly, we would not notice anything? appart from some weird visual stuff since light would be able to travel much faster through this compressed space?

the way i did it was to take the angle between the vector **r** and **dl**, as t = π/2 - θ , so the angle between the vector **r** and **d** becomes θ, hence by the definition of an angle in radians dl=r\*dθ. where r=d\*sec(θ), which gives me dl=d\*sec(θ)dθ . however my answer came out to be wrong.

&gt; it turns out that in einstein’s theory of general relativity, regions of space with positive energy actually push space outward. as space expands, it releases stored up gravitational potential energy, which converts into the intrinsic energy that fills the newly created volume. so even the expansion of the universe is controlled by the law of energy conservation.

is that something most physicists agree upon? wouldn't this mean the universe will stop expanding at some point, or is there an infinite amount of ""gravitational potential energy"" preexisting in the universe? if the latter is the case, that seems to also break the conservation of energy. 

also, i'm at a loss as how to conceptualize gravitational potential energy. does that mean there is energy that doesn't have mass, but has the potential to take a form that has mass?

it is my current understanding that for an observer far from a non-rotating black hole, they never really see matter fall into the event horizon. it just asymptotically approaches the event horizon as its light gets redshifted.

if that's accurate, then i imagine the result for an outside observer is that all matter that's falling into the blackhole should  be seen as an ever-falling red-shifting very thin spherical shell.

q1: how would any observer ever see a black hole increase in size if nothing ever crosses the event horizon?

q2: wouldn't this asymptotic behavior lead to black holes being perceived as an ever red-shifting spherical shell?

the holographic principle and the black hole entropy are related to the surface area of a black hole's event horizon. since all information that fell into the blackhole is seen as asymptotically approaching its boundary, then all the information whose future is in the interior volume of the event horizon should be compressed in a thin spherical shell on the event horizon.

q3: can this be seen as a valid intuition for why the black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon, and its relation to the holographic principle?

821,"[subtle question that starts obvious]: changes in electric and magnetic fields propagate at the speed of light, right?i'm about 99.999...% sure that the answer to the above question is ""yes.""

so now... the subtler question.

when typical high school/intro undergrad books will say that light slows down in a medium that is not a vacuum. but after reading a bit of feynman, i'm not sure that is entirely correct:  i'm understanding this chapter correctly, let us set up a situation where we have a light source on the left, a magical field detector on the right; vacuum everywhere, except a sheet of glass in between the two. then, the source is switched on.

if the glass sheet is not present, then the detector will read oscillating e and b fields corresponding to the frequency of the light being emitted. the time it will take for the detector to sense these changes is how long it takes light to propagate through the vacuum space. so far, so good, i think.

now, the sheet of glass is positioned between the source and detector, and then the source is turned on. will there be a difference in the time it takes for the detector to start showing the oscillating e and b fields?

if i understand feynman's text correctly, the answer is ""no""; in the medium of the glass, the phase velocity of light in the glass has slowed, because the oscillating e field induces an opposing e field in the glass by forcing the charge in the glass to line up/polarize. but the group velocity of light has not changed; throughout all of space, changes in the field continue to propagate at c. so, say, if with no sheet, it took 1 second for the detector to get a reading with no glass present then it should also take the same time--1 second-- for the detector to get a reading  when the glass is present. but, because the distinction between group and phse velocity is a fairly advanced concept, high school students are not exposed to this concept, nor are undergrads until they get to sophomore/junior/senior year, and instead the concept of ""phase velocity slows down"" is shorthanded to ""light slows down in a medium.""

is this the correct understanding of feynman's text, as well as a correct interpretation of current understanding about light? or am i getting something wrong?

if you look over at the[ dielectric section of the physics hypertextbook]( it says 
&gt; introducing a dielectric into a capacitor decreases the electric field, which decreases the voltage, which increases the capacitance.


so capacitance (the ratio of charge to voltage) is inversely proportional to the electric field strength right? 

but if you look over [at this website]( it says:
&gt; capacitance is directly proportional to the electrostatic force field between the plates. this field is stronger when the plates are closer together. therefore, as the distance between the plates decreases, capacitance increases.

874,"a black hole universe 

hi all

probably a silly question, but i was thinking about this last night and can't get it out of my head. hopefully someone can explain this to me.

imagine you have a universe that is big and has some (non-trivial) average density of matter. from a point at the edge of this universe, the gravitational effect could be calculated based on an assumption that all of the matter was located at a single point (i.e. the centre of mass of the universe) \[correct me if i am wrong on this\].

so i was thinking that if you made the universe bigger, but kept the average density of matter the same, the amount of matter (proportional to volume) would go up by the cube of the increase in radius, but the amount of gravity at the edge of the universe would increase as you only need to divide by r squared.

firstly, is the above correct, or am i making a mistake somewhere?

if the above is correct, then it would imply that if you grow the universe (but keep the average density the same, i.e. add uniform shells of matter at the outer edge), then at some point the edge of the universe will have enough gravity to effectively make it an event horizon. so the universe will become a black hole.

the problem i have with this is that shell theorem would say that each shell added should have no gravitational effect on the objects inside it. so to anything inside the universe there is no impact of the universe changing into a black hole. that seems really weird. it also seems to imply that for a given density, there is a maximum allowable size for a universe; is this right?

881,"question about relativity and causalitymy understanding of special relativity is that, while different observers moving at different speeds may disagree on the timings of events, they all agree on causality.

&amp;#x200b;

but i don't understand why. i recently read the fabric of the cosmos by brian greene and he uses an example of a train moving at relativistic speed. positioned on the train is a device which emits a flash of light. at an equal distance from the device, at opposite ends of the train carriage, are two individuals each armed with a gun. at the instant they see the flash of light they each fire their gun at the opposite individual.

&amp;#x200b;

from on board the moving train, both individuals see the flash of light at the exact same instant (because it has travelled the same distance in opposite directions) so both fire their guns at the exact same time. which means they're both dead.

&amp;#x200b;

but for an observer positioned on the ground, watching the train shoot past at relativistic speed, the individual facing the direction of travel sees the flash of light first, because he's moving into the beam of light. brian greene uses this example to illustrate that different observers will disagree on the simultaneity of events. but surely that means he will fire his gun first (because he sees the flash first) which means he kills the individual opposite before they have a chance to fire their gun. which results in a totally different outcome, not just a difference of perspective.

889,"simple physics question? (projectile acceleration/velocity)**an object is launched at a 45 degree angle from ground level and lands 240m away due to gravity; ignoring wind resistance, what is the initial velocity of the object?** what would be the simplest way of answering this? 

my main thought would be to find a calculation between how long it takes for the object's vertical velocity to go up and back down to the ground vs. the time it takes for the object to reach 240m. if t equals time of flight, vl equals the horizontal velocity at time 0, and vh equals the vertical velocity at time 0, then does:

* t = 240m/vl
* t = 2 \* ( vh/9.8m/s^(2) )

the first equation is pretty self explanatory, while the second comes from the time it takes for the object's vertical velocity to decelerate to 0 m/s due to gravity (presumably vh/9.8 m/s^(2)?) which would, since it is launched from ground level, be the same time it takes for it to accelerate back to the ground.

because the object is launched at a 45 degree angle, you can say that vh and vl are equal, and so vl = vh = vs therefore the true (45 degree) velocity of the object equals vs \* sqrt(2). so by setting the two equals equal to each other you get 240m/vs = 2 ( vs/9.8m/s^(2) ) which gives vs = 34.29m/s and gives the true velocity as 48.49m/s.

900,"one (probably) small thing that came to mindtwo masses pull each other, causing them to eventually meet, (assuming there was no interference) right? imagine an empty space where say two globes were let out with no friction involved. we know they would eventually meet, but why do they not form into some sort of bigger globe all together that is based around a newer center of gravity? and some other bonus questions regarding this issue:
a) assume two objects physically interract. could they be thought of as one object, just like how two negative charged objects meeting causes them to spread the electrons by q1 + q2 / r1 + r2... instead of the electrons pushing one another as much as possible like when the objects aren't touching?
b) assume a larger mass is pulling  a globe to itself (and vice versa) and assume that this large object cannot be tormented. why doesn't the globe collapse in order to be closer to the center of gravity? or why doesn't it simply get denser? and if it does, would it also get colder as it's molecules are now having a harder time to move around?
c) assume a large mass that is pulling a body of liquid and vice versa. as the liquid hits the surface, if the force is strong enough, would it turn into a solid, as it's molecules would try to be closer to the center of gravity; or does this connect to some other complicated system?

so i thought i had solved this problem but i haven't been able to recreate my solution i came up with a few days ago. generally i think i keep messing up my algebra but maybe i'm attacking the problem incorrectly.

so energy initial equals energy final due to conservation of energy

ei = 1/2m(velocity 1)^2 (kinetic energy only)

ef = 1/2m(velocity 2)^2 + mgh (kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy)

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(velocity final)^2 + mgh

velocity final is actually (1/3 velocity initial) so

1/2m(velocity inital)^2 = 1/2m(1/3velocity initial)^2 + mgh

mass cancels out entirely, and now velocity initial can just be referred to as ""v""

1/2v^2 = (1/2)(1/3v)^2 + gh

this is where i start to get lost in my algebra, i solved for v and ended up with 25.72 m/s for velocity. assuming g=9.8 and h = 30m

929,"not a typical physics question but looking for advice as a high-school physics student.hi all,

i'm a high school senior that is currently taking ap physics (algebra-based) which i assume is like the introductory course for college level physics. we had the ap exam for it last tuesday so we're not actually doing anything for the rest of the month in that course apart from one thing and that's what i'm here to ask about.

i want to get into computer engineering, but the college that i want to go to requires that i take *calculus* based physics. the credit that i get for algebra based physics from the exam i took last week does nothing for my engineering curriculum. as such, i signed up for the physics c: mechanics ap exam which is this coming monday, as this is the exam i need to get a 4 in to have any credit towards my engineering curriculum. 

i'm also in ap calculus bc, which is the calculus 2 equivalent in college. i'm doing *really* well in that class and have not a single worry about the calculus ap exam that's happening soon, so i have a good grasp on calculus i'd say. physics c: mechanics incorporates lots of calculus topics, since its calculus based after all.

my question to anyone that can answer it is basically this: what are some fundamental topics or ideas from physics c that i should learn myself before i go into this exam? i'm pretty good at regular physics, apart from maybe rotational motion which i could use a brush up on. what else can i do apart from look at released physics c material?

932,"momenthere's the problem: [ the solution: [ don't understand why (2) is true and (3) is true. i understand why (1) is false.

**what i've tried:**

(1) if the cg (center of gravity) of the chair is directly above the pivot p, then the chair will balance on its own, with or without the wall. the wall merely serves as a decorative purpose in this case and no force (including n and f) is applied onto the chair.

(2) using the same example as (1), i do not see the need for the ground to provide friction as there is no n by the wall on the chair.

(3) the example in (1) is an example of the statement. therefore i assume the wall and the ground to be rough, and the cg to be out of pq.

before i proceeded, i remember being taught that if the cg of an object (with no walls and only the ground) is above the pivot point, the object will topple over, due to the net moment produced by the weight when taking moments at the pivot point. 

however, in the problem, if the friction of the wall acts upwards, then it could balance the weight. since there is friction by the wall, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the wall. since there is a horizontal force (due to the normal force by the wall), the only force that could counteract it is the friction by the ground to the left. since there is friction by the ground, there is a normal force acting on the chair by the ground.",1,momenthere s problem    solution    understand     true     true  understand     false   what i ve tried      cg  center gravity  chair directly pivot p  chair balance own  without wall  wall merely serves decorative purpose case force  including n f  applied onto chair      using example     see need ground provide friction n wall chair      example     example statement  therefore assume wall ground rough  cg pq  proceeded  remember taught cg object  with walls ground  pivot point  object topple over  due net moment produced weight taking moments pivot point  however  problem  friction wall acts upwards  could balance weight  since friction wall  normal force acting chair wall  since horizontal force  due normal force wall  force could counteract friction ground left  since friction ground  normal force acting chair ground

973,"does the buoyant force on everyday objects due to the atmosphere affect the kinematics of said objects?so i started learning fluid mechanics; and after learning that the atmosphere is considered a fluid that has the potential to create a buoyant force on any object located in the atmosphere, i am wondering if this buoyant force would need to be taken into consideration for any precise calculations.

i calculated the buoyant force on a human at sealevel by the following means:

\[; f\_b = f\_t - f\_b ;\]

\[; f\_b = p\_t a - p\_b a ;\]

\[; f\_b = a (p\_t - p\_b) ;\]

\[; f\_b = a \\rho g h ;\]

then estimating (for a human): \[; h = 1.75 m;\], \[; m = 68 kg ;\], \[; \\rho = \\frac{1.2 kg}{m\^3} ;\] (this is the density of air at sea level), \[; a= \\pi (0.1524)\^2 m\^2 ;\]

\[; f\_b = 1.5 n ;\]

so this would mean that a scale would read to weigh 1.5 n less than you actually weigh. but my question is ""if your feet will press against the ground, inhibiting air from going in between the two. will this decrease the pressure on the bottom giving you an even higher buoyant force?"". also, ""for very large objects (with large areas), would the buoyant force need to be considered in order to correctly describe the physics of the object?""",1,buoyant force everyday objects due atmosphere affect kinematics said objects so started learning fluid mechanics  learning atmosphere considered fluid potential create buoyant force object located atmosphere  wondering buoyant force would need taken consideration precise calculations  calculated buoyant force human sealevel following means    f _b   f _t   f _b     f _b   p _t   p _b     f _b    p _t   p _b      f _b    rho g h   estimating  for human    h       m        kg      rho    frac     kg m       this density air sea level    a   pi        m       f _b       n   would mean scale would read weigh     n less actually weigh  question  if feet press ground  inhibiting air going two  decrease pressure bottom giving even higher buoyant force  also   for large objects  with large areas  would buoyant force need considered order correctly describe physics object

&amp;#x200b;

[ here we have 2 batteries in a circuit connected so that the electrons are flowing on two parallel lines which join then loop around to the anode.  but in the drawing, the current is flowing from the anode(i think) of the 17.5 v battery to the anode of the 4 v battery, then out the cathode of the 4v battery to the cathode of the 17.5 v battery. sorry if that's unclear

&amp;#x200b;

now i understand the difference between a galvanic and an electrolytic cell, and that in theory pushing electrons and energy the ""wrong way"" through the battery will result in the non spontaneous reaction occurring. but that isn't what is happening here. somehow the current is entering the anode, where it would then proceed to reduce the anode, but instead not only is it not being reduced, it is somehow oxidizing the cathode through what i suppose would be the salt bridge, and this doesn't appear to have any negative effects. 

&amp;#x200b;

apparently it ""doesn't matter what way you draw the current"" but then why not draw it correctly? and besides, every time i do draw what reasonably makes sense to me i get it wrong, and when i bring it to the teacher the first thing they do is draw the damn circuit like the picture above.

i was reading about the shor's algorithm lately and it goes like for a guess x, x^(p/2) +- 1 are actually multiples of factors of n. 

one explanation for this was that we should actually check it with some examples. so 3^4 is congruent to 1mod10 2^3 is congruent to 1mod7.
then they generalized it for all positive integers saying that any x^p is congruent to a 1mod(mn) where m is some multiple.

1015,"number of separable preferences for (n) issues in voting domains (explained inside the post)hey all! so, i was reading about ""separable preferences"" in voting domains. a little background on setting:

let's consider we have *n* (binary) issues and some voters who vote for either 0 or 1 (since binary issues) for each issue. we shall consider the combinatorial domain of preferences on all issues instead of one issue at a time (i.e., alternatives = d1 x d2 x d3, where d1 is domain of issue 1). 

&amp;#x200b;

a ranking order is *called as separable preference* if the preference of a voter for an issue (i) is same for every combination of alternatives of other (-i) issues. an example is,

111 &gt; 011 &gt; 101 &gt; 001 &gt; 110 &gt; 010 &gt; 100 &gt; 000

here, voter prefers alternative 1 to 0 for every issue (i) irrespective of the combinations of other issues {1,2,3}\\{i} i.e., 

**1**11&gt; **0**11,    **1**01&gt; **0**01,     0**1**1&gt; 0**0**1,     10**1**\&gt; 10**0** etc

informally, if a voter has separable preferences, he would just report the same top alternative that he has in combined domain when the issues are treated separately (single domain) i.e., if 110 is top alternative, he would report 1 for issue 1, 1 for issue 2 and 0 for issue 3.

now surely this order is not unique. so, i was just interested in finding how many such orderings are possible with the restriction of ""separable preferences"".

&amp;#x200b;

i worked on it and found that for every preferred (or top) alternative (eg: 111, there are 8 such), we have 48 such possible combinations which are separable. here's my work:

&amp;#x200b;

solving for 111 as top alternative,

obviously 111 should be placed at first position and 000 at the end of ranking. we need to fill the remaining 6 positions. if we observe clearly, we have 2 types of numbers (or alternatives) among the remaining 6. which are type 1 (110, 101, 011) and type 2 (100, 010, 001). clearly, each alternative from type 1 (eg: 110) is preferred to two alternatives in type 2 (010, 100) and is not comparable to the remaining alternative in type 2 bundle (001). and we can't compare any two alternatives of same type. so, their respective ordering shouldn't matter. so, we can solve this in two steps

&amp;#x200b;

* 111&gt; (type 1) &gt; (type 2) &gt; 000

since nothing in type 2 is more preferred to type 1 bundle, this ordering is separable and there are 3! \* 3! combinations of this type, hence 36 combinations

* 111&gt; (**any two from type 1**)&gt; (that single alternative from type 2 which is not comparable to the remaining alternative from type 1, obviously, this specific alternative turns out to be opposite (or negation?) of the remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (remaining alternative from type 1)&gt; (*remaining alternatives from type 2*)&gt; 000

eg: 111&gt; (110, 101)&gt; (100)&gt; (011)&gt; (010, 001)&gt; 000

there are (**3c2\*2!**)\* 1\* 1\* (*2!*) = 12

&amp;#x200b;

hence, 36+12=48 combinations. this can be solved because of less number of issues and alternatives. but, how to extend this to a general setting (n issues, a alternatives)? any help is appreciated also feel free to point out if i committed any mistake above. thanks!",0,number separable preferences  n  issues voting domains  explained inside post hey all  so  reading  separable preferences  voting domains  little background setting  let s consider  n   binary  issues voters vote either      since binary issues  issue  shall consider combinatorial domain preferences issues instead one issue time  i e  alternatives   d  x d  x d   d  domain issue     amp x b  ranking order  called separable preference  preference voter issue  i  every combination alternatives  i  issues  example is     gt     gt     gt     gt     gt     gt     gt    here  voter prefers alternative     every issue  i  irrespective combinations issues        i  i e       gt             gt              gt             gt       etc informally  voter separable preferences  would report top alternative combined domain issues treated separately  single domain  i e    top alternative  would report   issue      issue     issue    surely order unique  so  interested finding many orderings possible restriction  separable preferences   amp x b  worked found every preferred  or top  alternative  eg       such    possible combinations separable  here s work   amp x b  solving   top alternative  obviously   placed first position   end ranking  need fill remaining   positions  observe clearly    types numbers  or alternatives  among remaining    type             type             clearly  alternative type    eg     preferred two alternatives type          comparable remaining alternative type   bundle     can t compare two alternatives type  so  respective ordering matter  so  solve two steps  amp x b      gt   type     gt   type     gt    since nothing type   preferred type   bundle  ordering separable         combinations type  hence   combinations     gt   any two type   gt   that single alternative type   comparable remaining alternative type    obviously  specific alternative turns opposite  or negation  remaining alternative type   gt   remaining alternative type   gt   remaining alternatives type   gt    eg    gt        gt     gt     gt        gt      c                    amp x b  hence        combinations  solved less number issues alternatives  but  extend general setting  n issues  alternatives  help appreciated also feel free point committed mistake above  thanks

the distance between cars would be:d= (v\^2)/2a  (i know acceleration)

&amp;#x200b;

then, i thought, based on velocity, i can figure out the total distance until a car would not make it past the point because it was too far away. which is simply velocity\*time. then, the number of cars should be distance to the farthest car dividing by the spacing of individual cars.

&amp;#x200b;

however, that comes up with n = v\*t/((v\^2)/2a)

or, ignoring the known constants, n ∝ 1/v.

&amp;#x200b;

that  is counter intuitive to me. in my mind, there should have been a sweet-spot in the middle where going any faster is detrimental due to stopping distance, and any slower would be hurt by few vehicles being able to pass in the given time. i would expect as v approaches 0, that you would not get one whole car past the mark before the time was up, thus also going to zero. instead, as v approaches zero, i get infinite cars across.

1042,"i found this formula for calculating how to pass on payment processing fees and it works but i don't understand whyi'm embarrassed by my lack of basic mathematical skill, but nevertheless, i'm a freelancer and have to be able to understand this.

for the work i usually do, i usually just invoice the amount i'm charging and ask clients to pay in to my bank account. i have a client who for various reasons has to use a credit card to pay contractors and they suggested i setup a paypal account for this purpose so they can pay me that way.

this works fine, but paypal charges a 2.6% payment processing fee. i pass this on to the client, but i didn't realise that there's actually a flaw in how i've been doing this.

my total fee for the job was $2850. i added a 2.6% surcharge for paypal's processing fees, and invoiced my client for $2924.1, (2850 * 1.026). this all seemed fine, but then when i received my payment, and paypal deducted their fee i found myself left with $2847.77, not $2850. i tried to work out why i was shorted $2.23 and realised it was because the $76.33 that paypal had charged me was 2.6% of $2924.1 not, $2850 which makes sense of course, because that's how much the client paid me as per my invoice. so i realised it wasn't as simple as just charging the amount*1.026 to get the total plus processing fees incorporated.

again, i'm in general pretty embarrassed about my lack of mathematical ability so i found myself having to look this up on google for an answer, not knowing how i'd calculate it myself. i found a solution, and i tested it with my latest invoice and sure enough it leaves me with exactly $2850 as it should do, except the problem is i don't understand *how* it works. i don't think i should just blindly use a formula i don't understand, especially not as the amount i'll be charging will differ from amount*1.026 which to me seemed the intuitive way to calculate, so i may find myself having to explain why the amount invoiced, is what it is, and i currently wouldn't be able to.

the formula i found was

a / (100 - fee percentage)  * 100

so in my case

2850 / (100-2.6) * 100 =2926.0780287

2926.0780287 * 0.974 = 2850

1043,"question regarding base sets of numbers?????i’m not even sure if my question is being asked right, but i have stumbled in here on a layman’s quest to find the meaning of patterns in numbers...

i’ve realized that if you multiply any consecutive numbers by the same base10 number (0-9), and reduce the number by adding the remaining integers, you end up getting a pattern of numbers. i know it sounds kinda wonky but idk how else to explain it...

for example let’s take the base number 3

if i were to take random numbers such as 13, 14, 15, and multiply them by base 3, i would get 39, 42, and 45—reducing these integers by adding the digits to each other gets me 3, 6, and 9...

3 + 9 = 1 + 2 = 3

4 + 2 = 6

4 + 5 = 9


adding the next consecutive numbers 46, 47, and 48 would get me another cycle of 3, 6, and 9.

multiplying any number by a base 6 would get me consecutive combinations of 9, 6, 3...

does anyone know what this is called or what math properties this touches on???

i’ve been up at nights thinking about this and i don’t know what it is lol.

thanks for anyone’s help in advance!!!

* define π1(x,b): what are the elements, and what is the multiplication rule.
   * π1(x,b) is a fundamental group which is an equivalance class of loops that start and end at the base point b. x is a set. i'm not sure what the multiplication rule is, i know in a group its just an operation for any two elements of the group. so is the multiplication rule the same for fundamental groups? or does it mean like what homotopic with two ends the same? as in like, what defines a loop to be the same as another loop, or in the same equivalence class?

&amp;#x200b;

* true or false: if \[a\] and \[b\] are elements of π1(x,b) then \[a\]\[b\] = \[b\]\[a\].
   * i'm not sure about this. i learned in what groups are, which is a set with an operation that can be applied to every element in the set, and in groups they are only communitative if they are albeian, and it works for every element in the group. i'm not sure if this property works for fundamental groups, or it would only work if it is albein right? so i'm thinking false, unless it the group is albeian?  

* true of false: if x is a subset of y then π1(x,b) is a subgroup of π1(y,b).
   * i think this is true? i know that for z is a sub
* true or false: if x is a subset of **r**2 then π1(x,b) is the trivial group.
   * i think this is false.. i thought the trivial group is just like the constant function? so since x is a subset of r2 doesn't necesarially mean x is r1, in which case it would be the trivial group.

1073,"me and my friends made a game where you can battle each other . what are the best stats to assign points to, to have the highest probability of winning?here's a video example  how it works, 5 statistics each with a base stat of 5. strength, defense, precision, speed and health. you have 25 points to allocate as you wish. when allocating to health multiply by 2 but base stat is still 5. what i want to know is what is the statically best way to win, by allocating points in the correct stats.

the system of battle is: random number generate from the stat eg. speed stat 7 randomly generate a number from 1 to 7


here's how a battle plays out. 1 v 1. you generate a speed stat and so does your opponent. whoever has the higher number goes first. whoever had the highest attacks by generating from their attack stat. you have a choice to block which means generate from your defense stat. if you generate a higher number then the attack no health is taken away. if you generate lower than the attack its attack number - defense number then that's taken away from your health. you also have the choice to try to evade the attack. you generate from speed. then your opponent generates from attack precision. if attack precision is higher then speed the attack number is taken from your health. if speed is higher then no damage is taken. this continues until someone drops to 0 health 

if two people generate the same number on attack/defense no damage is taken. if two people generate the same number on speed/precision you generate again


you cannot block/evade three times in a row.  ie after you block twice you must evade and vice versa

1074,"newton's laws confusionwhen considering forces in an elevator moving at constant speed, by newton's first law the sum of forces must be opposite and equal (so forces up equal the forces down). however, in [this]( photo, the tension in the elevator is given as mg + mg (where m is lift weight, and m is person's weight). by newton's third law, surely the reaction force of the lift on the person should cancel out as they are equal. so if i name the forces as follows

mg - weight of lift

mg - weight of man

t - tension

rm - reaction force between the man and the lift

1078,"looking for the name/idea behind this theoretical computer science math problem somewhat like the knapsack problem that can be solved with dynamic programminganyone know what this problem is called/commonly known as?

imagine you have a group of k identical coins. imagine you have a non-decreasing function value, that takes in a number ranging from 1 to k (inclusive), and outputs a number. the function is non-decreasing, so value(1) &lt;= value(2) &lt;= value(3) and so on and so forth.

how can you group your coins in such a way that their total value is as large as possible?

this is hard to explain in words so let me try to give an example. imagine if we were doing this problem with k=8: so you have 8 coins, and you have the following value function:

* value(1) = 1

* value (2) = 5

* value(3) = 8

* value(4) = 9

* value(5) = 10

* value(6) = 17

* value(7) = 17

* value(8) = 20

different arrangements of your 8 coins can result in a different total value. for instance, if you split your 8 coins into 1, 3 and 4, then your total value = value(1) + value(3) + value(4) = 18. if you split your coins into piles of 2 and 6, the total value = value(2) + value(6) = 23. alternatively, if you just have one pile of 8 coins, then total value = value(8) = 20.

a valid output for this problem is a sequence of positive integers, such that the sum of those integers is equal to k.

the optimal output for this problem (what we want an algorithm to output) is the valid output that has the largest total weight.

i've come up with a method of my own, which begins as a round robin (everyone plays against everyone), and tracks the individual wins and losses of every competitor. following logic such as b beats c, a beats b, therefore a beats c. since there is enough information to predict a beats c, a will not compete with c, and that eliminates the number of rounds needed.

this strikes me as kind of a sorting algorithm, but i just feel like the problem has already been solved somewhere, and i want to see how it's done.

1132,"stokes theoremso, this week in calculus 3 we learned about divergence theorem and stokes (kelvin-stokes) theorem.  

the flux integral of a closed loop is equal to the surface integral of the curl of the vector field of any region bounded by that loop.  

the divergence theorem which stated that the flux through any surface is equal to the integral of the divergence through the enclosed volume.

for stokes theorem, we were able to pick any surface that was bounded by that region.  if it was a circle, we could have used a cone, the disk, a hemisphere etc.  i am confused on if or how you could pick any volume bounded by the surface.  is it some higher dimensional interaction that we cannot see, but still possible?

i am an ee major and understand the use of the divergence theorem for calculating a charge, and using an arbitrary surface, but that is only because that charge is the source of the entire field.  is there some way of doing a similar arbitrary volume/surface for generic divergence theorem problems?

the above holds true in most simple scenarios, however my issue is that i do not have an equal first period of cash flow as its shorter. to accommodate this i need to adjust the present value formula above so that it is {c / (1+i)\^(1-n+w)}, w = number of days between settle date and next coupon date / number of days within the period. essentially it is saying the first period is not a full period, there for needs to be &lt;&gt; 1 but .5 or whatever w works out to be. at this point i can determine all the npvs for each period using the adjusted formula and everything checks out. however, i can no longer do the npv roll forward approach as it doesn't get me 100% to the next npv. i feel like i need to adjust the npv roll forward formula to accommodate this w that was introduced into the present value formula above. not sure if it needs to be where the {initial cost \* periodic rate...then there is some math formula added... - interest on the next cash flow}.",0,advanced npv questionso basic npv simply sum  c      i n  period income cash flow  use excel s irr npv functions calculate properly  period rate  i  need npv function per say get next npv  simply take initial cost  minus principal next cash flow period  plus  initial cost   periodic rate   interest next cash flow period  derive next npv  called npv roll forward   amp x b  holds true simple scenarios  however issue equal first period cash flow shorter  accommodate need adjust present value formula  c      i   n w  w   number days settle date next coupon date   number days within period  essentially saying first period full period  needs  lt gt       whatever w works be  point determine npvs period using adjusted formula everything checks out  however  longer npv roll forward approach get    next npv  feel like need adjust npv roll forward formula accommodate w introduced present value formula above  sure needs  initial cost   periodic rate then math formula added    interest next cash flow

1180,"can you make a simple equation to eliminate artifactually large differences from a sample that contains ""circular"" numbering? explanation in comments.hi everyone,

i'll try to keep this short. i have a sample where numbers range from 0 to 179. 0=180=360 and 90=270. 

these numbers represent the axis of astigmatism of corneas. since astigmatism usually is ""regular,"" or of equal magnitude 180 degrees apart, we only measure from 0 to 179.


however, because the axis of astigmatism is something measured in degrees, the numbers at the end are actually very close to the numbers at the beginning (since it comes full circle). aka, 179 could also be considered to be -1, 175 could be -5, etc.


let's say i want to take the difference between two measurements: 52 and 50 - easy, the difference is 2. but if i want to take the difference between 179 and 1, the difference should be -2 instead of 178.

obviously, i could get the answer by subtracting 180 from 179 (as above) so that the numbers are closer to the starting point of 0, but i figured we could create an equation that would work with any numbers.

the problem only happens when comparing numbers at the beginning and end of the circle. 

the question is: **is there some way to make a simple equation so that if anybody looked at the measurements and used the equation, that they could easily find the true difference between the numbers?** i was trying to play around with absolute values but couldn't get it to work out perfectly for all numbers.

&gt;*to take a mulligan, a player shuffles their 7 starting cards in their hand back into their deck, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size (7), then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their deck in any order. once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player's opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. this process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. a player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards.*

in multiplayer games, you get 1 free mulligan, (so no putting cards back from your hand until after the second mulligan)

my question is about the card ""serum powder"". which says:

&gt;""any time you could mulligan and serum powder is in your hand, you may exile all the cards from your hand *(remove the cards from the deck permanently)*, then draw that many cards. you can do this in addition to taking mulligans.

so basically you could reset the cards discarded down to zero again.

1201,"is it possible to prove that the riemann hypothesis is undecidable?i am not sure if this will be intelligible; if not, please do not hesitate to ask a clarifying question.

&amp;#x200b;

so there is [this]( numberphile video were a guy talks about the gödel incompleteness theorem. he then goes on about undecidability in general and mentions that a strange way of proving rh would be to show that it is undecidable within our system of axioms. because if it is, it means that we won't find a counterexample to rh since in doing so the problem would become decidable, so there are no counterexamples and so rh holds. without being sure that this is the correct terminology, i use the word ""undecidable"" to qualify any statement that can't be proven right nor wrong in a given axiomatic system.

&amp;#x200b;

so essentially: ""if i prove that rh is undecidable, then it is decidable, because i then know it's true"". this makes me conclude that you can't prove that rh is undecidable, because otherwise you end up contradicting yourself. so there is my problem. either this trick of proving rh the guy mentions is essentially useless, or i am confused.

&amp;#x200b;

one way that i get this wrong could be that i mix up the instances when we confine ourselves to our axiomatic system (lets call it s) and the instances when we go outside to ""look in"". because it could be that the proof of rh undecidability in s is made outside of s. lets look closely at the steps of my reasoning to see what i mean (brackets for clarity):

1. assume that we can prove that \[rh is undecidable in s\] in s
2. then we have proof in s that we cannot disprove rh in s
3. then we have proof in s that there is no counter example to rh in s
4. then we have proven rh in s
5. then rh is decidable in s
6. in total, if we can prove that \[rh is undecidable in s\] in s, then rh is decidable in s
7. thus we can't prove that rh is undecidable in s

this reasoning seems robust, but the guy was maybe referring to a proof that \[rh is undecidable in s\] that is made outside of s, perhaps in a system s' that is stronger than s, in which case the above reasoning doesn't apply (§1 doesn't hold). but that would raise more questions: what would s' look like? at what point would we regard s' as elementary enough as to be convinced by the proof? or maybe my reasoning fails elsewhere?

&amp;#x200b;

the problem i have is ""is it possible to prove that the riemann hypothesis is undecidable?""; if yes where does my reasoning fail? if it fails in §1 the way i considered just above, then what about s'?

1251,"tricky question found in an old informatics olympiad for high schoolersa sequence of positive integers, a[1], a[2], a[3], . . . , a[n] is called a special sequence,
if a[1] divides a[2], a[2] divides a[3], and so on until a[n−1] divides a[n], and if
all the elements are distinct. for example, (2, 4, 8, 32) is a special sequence. but
(4, 2, 8) is not, because 4 does not divide 2. similarly (2, 4, 4, 8) is also not special,
because the elements are not distinct.  

you need to find the number of special sequences such that all the elements of the
sequence are from the set {1, 2, . . . , k}.  

suppose k = 3. the special sequences possible are (1),(2),(3),(1, 2),(1, 3). so
the answer would be 5.

1263,"does there exist a function that does this?hello, i know almost nothing about math, so please forgive me if this question is really stupid. 

background: recently i was playing a video game and wondered if it would be possible to quantify a player’s skill at the game, based on how likely they are to win against another player. so, for example, if player 1 has a 50% chance of winning against player 2, their skill would be equal, because they are evenly matched. i then arbitrarily determined that i have a skill of 1. 
based on common sense, the following should be true:

- if someone has a 50% chance of winning against me, his skill = my skill = 1.

- if someone has a 100% chance of winning against me, that’s impossible. unless that person is infinitely skilled there should be at least a chance that i’ll win.

- if someone has a 0% chance of winning against me, that’s also impossible. unless he has a skill of 0 there should be at least a chance that he’ll win.

that is about where my brain gave up. so, would it be possible to write a mathematical function that calculates a number for skill, given these assumptions? or were any of my assumptions wrong?

1292,"two functions equivalent if they have equal values on an interval?this was a shower thought, but unfortunately i've been out of school for too long and my analysis skills are way too rusty for me to prove this one myself. curious if this is true:

let's say you have two real-valued, polynomial, continuous functions f and g. (keep them well-behaved!)

you also have some interval [a, b], with a &lt;&gt; b, such that for all numbers x in the interval, f(x) = g(x). in other words, there's a  interval over which the two functions have equal values, and that interval doesn't consist of a single point.

does this necessarily mean f and g are the same function?

it seems so, to me: having the same values over the interval means that their ""shape"" is the same. this suggests the derivatives (and all higher order derivatives) are the same as well, if you consider the derivatives as a description of the slope/curve behavior of the function. (i don't know this is true for sure, but it *seems* true.)

if that's true, then call y the ""first number just outside [a, b]"" which i am well aware is not a real thing -- take the limit as y approaches b from the right, etc. intuitively, if the shape of the curve over [a, b] is identical for each function, then the value just outside the interval should also be identical because the behavior of the functions as they ""exit the interval"" are the same. which means you can expand the interval to [a, y] with y &gt; b and still maintain the truth of the statement about the interval.

the same logic should apply with z approaching a from the left. accordingly, you can expand the interval to all reals, and therefore the two functions are equivalent because they have the same values over the entire set of real numbers.

this obviously breaks down if you have non-continuous functions or if your interval is only a single number. but if you keep to nice, well-behaved polynomial functions with a an arbitrarily large interval, this seems right.

10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000

this made sense to me. however, after looking up the formula for combinations in any kind of scenario i became confused.

i read that the formula: ncr = n! / r! * (n-r)! is used to calculate item combinations, where n = total number of items and r = amount of items to choose. so taking the 4-digit password into account i did:

10! / 4! * (10 - 4)! = 108,864,000

this is obviously incorrect, but i'd just like to know why. what factor accounts for the huge difference in integer size? when would this formula be used as oppose to the basic method used to calculate the correct answer?

r = 3/4
b = 1/4

you take 10 coins out and put them into a box. what is the chance that your box has exactly 4 red coins?

the way i'm thinking about it is kind of imagining the tree diagram. follow one branch of it where you get 4 red coins and then 6 blue coins the probability would be 

(1/4)^6 * (3/4)^4

for that particular branch. now that branch is just one of many ways of getting 4 red coins and so you have to multiply the probability by the number of ways you can get 4 red coins. i thought that for this you should use permutations since that probability is found by considering just one **order** of steps to get the desired outcome of 4 red, or one path down the tree. the actual answer is to use the combinations.

1318,"can someone help me understand something i just read about how multiplying random variables?edit: turns out i should have just kept reading the textbook instead of spending hours searching for more info. they only mentioned it in a single sentence at the start of the chapter, but had a whole section explaining it in more detail that made it click for me at the end. they even had the formula i was looking for for an unbiased estimate of long term annualised returns based on horizon in the final subsection, [seen here]( reading a textbook that's talking about time-series stock price data and average returns. it talks about the difference between arithmetic average return and geometric average return. one of the things it says is that if you have a number of years of i.i.d. random returns you can predict the expected return for the next year as the arithmetic average of the historical returns. for example, if you have:

2015: r = 6%

2016: r = 7%

2017: r = 5%

2018: r = 6%

then, assuming that all years are i.i.d, the expected return in 2014 would be 6% (the average of all those years). this makes sense, since they're all taken from the same distribution, so it's like looking at previous rolls of a die to determine the average value obtained when rolling that die.

but then it talks about how the expected ear over a multiple-year period is not the same as the expected return for a single period. so even if you expect to earn 6% return on average every year from 2019 to 2022, you don't expect to earn:

    1.06^4 - 1 = 26.2%

over that four year period. instead the expected ear would be slightly less (something like 5.8% per year), so that the expected four year return would be:

    1.058^4 - 1 = 25.3%

the rationale is that because each year's return is a random variable, and multiple positive variances have a greater effect than multiple negative variances, the arithmetic mean is biased when used over multiple years.

i tested this in excel using randomly generated data from a normal distribution and can see that it's true. generating 10,000 random returns for three years with a mean return of 6.5% i can see that the average ear over a two year period is around 6.3-6.4% and the average ear over a three year period is around 6.25-6.35%.

i'd love to read more about specifically why this happens, because in my textbook it was only given as a footnote. their rationale doesn't seem to make sense to me because if positive variances had a bigger effect than negative variances wouldn't you expect the ear to be *larger* than the arithmetic mean? like by my intuition i'm imagining an example where you expected 6.5% return every year, but some years you got 7% and some years you get 6%. if you get 6.5% two years in a row as expected then you get 13.4% return. if you get 7% two years in a row by variance then you get a 14.5% return: a gain of 1.068%. if you get 6% two years in a row by variance then you get 12.4%, a loss of only 1.063%. so you would gain *more* on average over two years than you'd expect if it was a static 6.5% p.a., not less.

the other thing i'd like to be able to do is work out what the expected return actually is for an n-year period given the expected yearly return. all i know now is that it's less than the expected yearly return itself, but not by how much. i expect the 'how much' is calculated using the variance of the random variable, and it'd be great to see exactly how that works out.",0,someone help understand something read multiplying random variables edit  turns kept reading textbook instead spending hours searching info  mentioned single sentence start chapter  whole section explaining detail made click end  even formula looking unbiased estimate long term annualised returns based horizon final subsection   seen here  reading textbook that s talking time series stock price data average returns  talks difference arithmetic average return geometric average return  one things says number years i i d  random returns predict expected return next year arithmetic average historical returns  example  have     r         r         r         r      then  assuming years i i d  expected return   would     the average years  makes sense  since they re taken distribution  like looking previous rolls die determine average value obtained rolling die  talks expected ear multiple year period expected return single period  even expect earn    return average every year      expect earn                   four year period  instead expected ear would slightly less  something like      per year  expected four year return would be                   rationale year s return random variable  multiple positive variances greater effect multiple negative variances  arithmetic mean biased used multiple years  tested excel using randomly generated data normal distribution see true  generating     random returns three years mean return      see average ear two year period around          average ear three year period around          i d love read specifically happens  textbook given footnote  rationale seem make sense positive variances bigger effect negative variances expect ear  larger  arithmetic mean  like intuition i m imagining example expected      return every year  years got    years get    get      two years row expected get      return  get    two years row variance get      return  gain      get    two years row variance get      loss      would gain  more  average two years expect static      p a  less  thing i d like able work expected return actually n year period given expected yearly return  know less expected yearly return itself  much  expect  how much  calculated using variance random variable  it d great see exactly works out

1432,"solving collisions using vectorshi all,

&amp;#x200b;

i'm trying to calculate the speed of a moving sphere after it collides with a stationary sphere. collision will be ellastic and the stationary sphere will remain stationary. i can solve it analytically using lines and all but i'm trying to implement this on an fpga and the code will be written in verilog. so i'm stuck with integer maths and i can't use trigonometric functions and square root. in addition, i have a little time window to make the calculation so long calculations are problematic.

&amp;#x200b;

i have a solution that gives correct answers but it's a long and complex equation to synthesize as a circuit, so i need a simpler approach, that only uses addition and subtraction if possible. neither nor my friends came up with solution unfortunately. tha ball will be drawn on a screen.

&amp;#x200b;

known variables: 

* center of stationary ball
* center of moving ball at the instant of collision
* point of collision
* speed vector of moving ball:

1. for this vector we have two variables. first one is the amount of movement in the given direction in terms of pixels. second one is the amount of clock cycles that needs to pass before the ball moves and is redrawn on the screen. 
2. amount of movement is constant, that is, ball moves by 1 pixel in each direction when it's redrawn. to change the speed, instead of redrawing the ball after 500000 cycles, we redraw the ball after 400000 cycles so it seemslike it sped up and vice versa.
3. given above information, we can define the speed of the ball as: v\_x=1/c\_x and v\_y=1/c\_y where c is the amount of clock cycles required before the ball is redrawn.
4. one final note: you can ignor 1, 2, 3 if you don't understand and use a single vector v=(vx,vy). i can make the corrections hopefully.

however, i would like help recalculating this speed if we were to give a much more massive particle, such as an iron nucleus, the same amount of kinetic energy. some of the online relativity calculators i found were not precise enough to measure speeds this extremely close to c.

1496,"trying to come up with a formula to calculate corrected differential pressure based on rate of flow.i work at an airport. i perform quality control checks on fueling equipment, one of which is a daily differential pressure (dp) check. (psi before filtration / psi after filtration) according to our guidelines, we must record observed dp, and we must also record *corrected* dp. 

corrected dp in this case represents what the dp would be at the maximum rated flow of the refueling unit. the maximum dp allowed at 100% flow is 15 psi. basically, we have to calculate the corrected dp to determine whether the dp would be above or below 15 psi if the unit were at max flow. i've asked for years what the formula was and nobody has been able to tell me. thus far, we've had to use a computer program that figures it out for us, and i'm tired of not totally understanding how it works. here is the info i know. 

we have something called a curve chart which shows the graph of the max dp at your observed flow rate. the line representing max dp is curved, hence the name, which also means it is an exponential function, because the differential pressure increases exponentially with flow rate. 

max dp at 100% flow is 15 psi. max dp at 50% is 6.5 psi. we'll say that flow rate (%) is x, and dp is y. basically, the line on the graph begins at (0,0) and ends at (100,15) while passing through (50, 6.5,) and i have no idea how they came up with this graph.

here is an actual example from april 30, 2019. a refueling unit with a max flow rate of 450 gpm (100%,) observed flow rate of 210 gpm (46.66...%,) and an observed dp of 2 psi, the corrected dp was 5 psi. 

it may as well be magic, apparently, because nobody can prove to me on paper how they came up with 5 psi. i'm about 13 yrs removed from any sort of advanced math, so i'm a bit rusty to say the least. i don't remember the last time i felt this dumb while trying to figure something out.

1522,"what numbers are feasibility constructible?after a course in abstract algebra at university, we ended with a fun little topic: ruler and compass constructions. we showed with the algebra we had learned, that the constructible numbers are a field, closed under square roots.

recently after i was chatting to my uncle, who in constructing his barn, uses a 3,4,5 (meter) pythagorean triangle to give almost perfect right angles.

my question, is what numbers are “feasibly” constructible in this way? by this i mean say i give you a unit length and designate a circle of radius n, in r^2 in which you may construct numbers, with only a ruler and compass. (by this i mean, for example “adding” two numbers together by drawing one line segment directly after another)

clearly, no number greater than 2n can be constructed, as this would definitely not lie within the circle, but there seems no lower bound (if n&gt;2) as we can have 1+1, followed by 1/2, ... , (1/2)^m (as we can happily perform multiplication and division within the circle). would the answer be something to do with the primes less than n, in terms of the fractions we can generate?

1525,"gentleman jack currency questionhi everyone! i am new to reddit and this is my first post.

&amp;#x200b;

**context:**

i have recently been watching the hbo television show gentleman jack and have been loving it. i live in canada, so there are already five episodes out and no spoilers but i have a currency question related to the show. the show is set in 1832 and the protagonist offers to sell her coal pits to a buyer. the price per acre that she offers is 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies). as the inflation rates have significantly changed from then, i was wondering how much this would be in today's currency for context when the characters are talking about prices on the show. i did some calculations last night and was wondering if the method needs to be better and if the answer i received is reasonable.

&amp;#x200b;

**problem and solution that i found:**

according to wikipedia, before 1971, british pounds were divided into 20 shillings of 12 pence, which makes 240 pence (rather than the current division of 100 pence today) per pound. so with the price at 226 pounds (£), 17 shillings and six pence (pennies) per acre, assuming that each pound is 240 pence (as its set in 1832), amount in pounds = 226\*240 = 54 240 pence, amount in shillings = 17\*12 = 204 pence and then there is 6 pence. the total is = 54 240 + 204 + 6 = 54 450 pence.

&amp;#x200b;

using this u.k. inflation calculator [ i divided 54 450/240 to get the amount in pounds it would be which is 226.875 (as it is unclear to me if this calculator accounts for the 240 pence in a pound pre-1971 issue). inserting this number into this calculator with the start year at 1832 and the end year at 2019, it's £25,190.91 per acre in today's currency. by using google's currency calculator, that would be $42, 854.78 canadian dollars per acre or $31,883.88 u.s. dollars per acre.

&amp;#x200b;

is this a reasonable answer? are there any adjustments that must be made to the calculations? is there a different approach i should have taken to the problem? please let me know!

if i pay for the benefits as a deduction on my paycheck and my yearly salary is bumped up an exactly equal amount, there will come a certain number of hours (y) worked per week at which i recieved the benefit tax free. 

to clarify, the benefit is free with 40 hours worked per week, just pay the tax on the benefit come tax time.

the point of this equation is to figure out how many hours of overtime are required for the taxes to pay for themselves.



example: 
$20 an hour prior wage.
$1000 in health benefits given as a $0.50 raise (50 working weeks, 40 hours a week = salary based on 2000 hours)

new wage: $20.50
new healthcare benefit: $1000
tax rate = x


***above edited for clarity, below added as a solution. feel free to check my work.

x = tax rate
y = overtime hours needed per week for the ""benefits raise"" to also pay for it's own taxes.

y = (((1÷(1-x))×40)−40)÷1.5

1541,"rules for generalized tensor algebra and calculusi'm attaching at the bottom an example of a derivation for momentum continuity to illustrate what i'm talking about.  it seems like eventually you get to a point in the multivariable algebra and calculus where the rules and notation are less standardized.  i feel like i'm missing a standard set of rules for how to deal with keeping track of tensor order and rank, and things like when are some operations commutative/distributive or not.  frequently i find myself having to scour wikipedia for obscure rules and identities that i've never heard of or seen before.  for example, today in this derivation i needed to look up what a dyad was (the multiplication of u\_vec with itself as an outer product) and how to take a divergence of a dyad.  i get the vague impression that inner products reduce the order of the tensor product and outer products increase the order of the tensor product, but i'm not entirely sure about how this stuff generalizes.  i'm also starting to work with optimization problems and needing to get way more familiar with generalized multivariable operations that map vector spaces to vector spaces, and generalized derivatives and gradients where you specify what you are taking it with respect to.

&amp;#x200b;

my general question is, ""is there a good resource that covers generalized rules for multivariable algebra/calculus that handles tensor stuff in a standardized way?""

1543,"n people, how many ways are there to choose a committee of n peopletwo students are given the following problem: from n people, how many ways are there to choose a committee of n people, with one person chosen as the president? one student gives $n\\binom{n}{n}$, while the other student gives an answer of $n\\binom{n-1}{n-1}$.

by writing out the binomial coefficients, show that the two answers are equal.     

the binomial coefficient states that $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

thus in the first students case: $n\\binom{n}{n} = \\frac{nn!}{n!(n-n)!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-1)!(n-n)!}$.

 in the second students case: $n\\binom{n-1}{n-1} = \\frac{n(n-1)!}{(n-1)!\[(n-1)-(n-1)\]!}$

which can be simplified to $\\frac{n!}{(n-1)!\[(n-1)-(n-1)\]!}$.

if we set the two equal to eachother we get: $\\frac{n!}{(n-1)!(n-n)!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-1)!\[(n-1)-(n-1)\]!}$

hello all!

i am trying to generate randomized teams with a caveat that each sorting will maximize the number of new people together on a team. this is for a school orientation where we are trying to get people to meet as many new people as possible

background info: this is for setting up groups for multiple activities in a day. we will have 1 activity where we divide all the people into teams for the event. for the next activity, we want to divide people (same group as in the first activity) into different teams (of a different number of people per team from the first activity) but maximize the number of new exposures so that people are on teams with new people. then do it again for a third set.

current thoughts: i was thinking of assigning random values to the groups each time then just sorting by number and making teams this way, but that does not guarantee any level of maximal exposure. the maximal exposure part is what i currently struggle with. i am able to get two unique groups simply with excel but cannot figure out how to make the third group unique.

this was my thinking:

the number of ways to arrange the answers randomly is 4^(100) because each question has 4 different possibilities.

say you put the sequence abcd on the first place. then you randomly put all the remaining answers down. this has 4^(96) possibilities. but then, the sequence abcd can go in any of 97 places, so the probability should be:

97\*4^(96)/4^(100)=97/256.

but this falls apart if the test has 259 or more questions because then the probability will be 256\*4^(255)/4^(259)=256/256=1 or greater. but there are obviously still ways that the sequence never appears like (a,a,a,a,a...).

*wikipedia gives this ""in its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols""*

*so far every source i've come across states that algebra is the solving of problems via symbolism and manipulating symbolism. most also go further to say that most word problems can be solved arithmetically or with algebra. what you seem to be saying here is that applying any form of calculations in real life is algebra?*

&gt;yes, 100/10=10 is arithmetic. having $100 and 10 kg and solving for x number of dollars per kg and knowing how to set up the arithmetic to solve for x is algebra.  
&gt;  
&gt;*20mg of mg of protein in 60ml of urine is 20/60. isn't that the entire equation?*  
&gt;  
&gt;no. 20mg/60ml=0.33mg/ml is the whole equation. and again, 20mg/60ml = x mg/ml, solve for x is what you’re doing really quickly with basic math, but setting up that equation and solving for the unknown is algebra. someone could say the answer is 60/20=3, and their arithmetic is right (because 60 divided by 20 does equal 3), but their algebra is wrong because they solved for the wrong thing (x ml per mg instead of x mg per ml)

lastly, i also stated that ratios and fractions can be taught and understood without algebra and that there are both algebraic and arithmetic fractions which means that they are quite different forms of math beyond algebra just giving units or meanings to simple arithmetic.

 i've begun to learn about complex numbers, right now using [this]( lecture series as a stating point. i've heard of the mandelbrot set and julia sets throughout my life, and i'm now interested to learn about it more deeply (although i am starting quite shallow).

my question is this: is [this description]( of the mandelbrot and julia sets accurate? i've never come across an explanation that discussed the subject from this angle. specifically, the information regarding the dimensionality and intersection of the ""objects"".  i admit that i find this description intriguing, but i'm looking to confirm whether this information is an accurate portrayal of the mathematics.

thanks kindly,

if we present someone with a 5% increase now and a 10% increase at a later date, it works out to be exactly the same as if we present a 10% increase now and a 5% increase later.

the flip side of this scenario is also true.  if employee a earns $50,000 and receives a 10% increase, their salary becomes $55,000.  if they are presented with a 5% increase at a later date, their salary becomes $57,750.

**question 1** \- a grocery store stocks 1-gallon cartons of skim milk, 1% milk, 2% milk, and whole milk. a customer is asked to buy 10 gallons of milk. the customer needs to buy at least one carton of each type of milk.

how many different ways can the kinds of milk to buy be selected?

&amp;#x200b;

a: 120

b: 84

c: 210

d: 286

&amp;#x200b;

there are 4 different types of milk. we must acquire 10 in total with at least 1 of each type. once the 4 are chosen, then we have 6 remaining gallons to acquire. doesn't the question essentially ask what are the different ways we can choose the remaining 6 gallons from the 4 different types?

in that case, since there are 4 different options for each gallon and 6 gallons to be chosen without regard to arrangement, wouldn't that give us 4\^6/6? (obviously incorrect because it is too large)

&amp;#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**question 2** \- a random experiment consists of tossing a fair 6-sided die repeatedly.

how many tosses are required to be certain that the probability that at least one '6' appears is greater than or equal to 1/2?

a: 3

b: 5

c: 6

d: 4

&amp;#x200b;

a single toss of a fair die would give us a probability of 1/6 to get a 6. if we toss it 3 times, we would get 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 chance to get a 6 so that answer is a. is this correct?

&amp;#x200b;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**question 3** \- n is an integer between 0 and 9.

for how many values of n does \[123,3n2\] = \[0\] mod 8, where 123,3n2 is a six-digit number?

a: 2

b: 5

c: 4

d: 3

&amp;#x200b;

are we suppose divide all variations of 123,3n2 by 8 and see if there are any remainders to determine the number of times 8 evenly divides 123,3n2? in that case, 8 evenly divides the different variations of 123,3n2 4 times so the answer is c, correct?

&amp;#x200b;

also, why are there square brackets around those numbers - i've never seen them in my reading material but for some reason they show up on the sample test? 

&amp;#x200b;

**question 4** \- let n = 12 = (2\^2) + (2\^3)

given that (m\^2) = 51 (mod 59), what is (m\^12) (mod 59)?

&amp;#x200b;

a: 7

b: 36

c: 3

d: 30

&amp;#x200b;

is there some kind of mistake? they assign n in the beginning but then the problem is in terms of m. anyway, i am quite lost on what to do here. i would appreciate help. how can i tie this information together to get the answer?

**question 5** \- given the characteristic equation: x\^(n + 1) = 2x\^(n - 1), what is it when expressed as a explicit function?

b: 3 + n x 2\^n

c: 3 + n x 2\^(n + 1)

d: 1 + 2\^(n + 1)

&amp;#x200b;

when i divide the equation by x\^(n - 1), i get x\^2 = 2. if i subtract 2 to both sides, i get (x\^2) -2. at this point, i would usually factor the polynomials to get the value of x but i'm not sure how to do so cleanly so i'm stuck here.

1723,"reasoning behind the probability in a random dice systemi'm curious as to *why* a random dice system i analyzed is showing the results it did.

to put a long story short, i analyzed the probabilities involved in a random dice system that another group created, suspicious that their system wasn't actually evenly balanced between two choices (which is what they try to maintain).

----------------------------------------

here are the rules:

1) two players choose a ""threshold"" with a range of 100, limited between 0 and 999. for example, player one chooses a threshold of 0-100, while player 2 chooses a threshold of 600-700.

2) each player rolls a 999-sided die, and compares the results.

3) the higher roll wins, except when the roll falls within their threshold.

3a. - a roll within the player's threshold will win over a roll outside a threshold, no matter what. for example, player one with a threshold of 0-100 rolls a 50, while player 2 with a threshold of 600-700 rolls an 800. player one wins, for being in their threshold.

3b. - if both players roll inside their threshold, the higher number wins.

----------------------------------------

i ran a simulation of each threshold playing against each other threshold 100,000 times, and these were the results:

threshold of 0-100 secured victory against:
...
average win rate = 53601 

threshold of 100-200 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 52790.1 

threshold of 200-300 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 52006.2 

threshold of 300-400 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 51196 

threshold of 400-500 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 50356.5 

threshold of 500-600 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 49563.8 

threshold of 600-700 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 48740.4 

threshold of 700-800 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 47984.5 

threshold of 800-900 secured victory against: 
...
average win rate = 47120 

threshold of 900-999 secured victory against: 
...

so i ran across this equation that my stuff doesn't like:

ve = vo + d * ( r x l )

where d is a directional cosine matrix (no units) and r is in radians/second and l is in meters.  the v's are velocities so they are m/s. (btw, ""x"" is cross product)

so it seems to me, that ""r x l"" would be a vector that is in radian*meters/second rather than merely meters/second.  that instead of the top part of r being radians, it should be unitless so that the overall units end up m/s like the velocities.

so this achievement is called a badge. the badge reads: win a game as the jumpmaster. the jumpmaster is the person who is in charge of jumping from the ship. your team of three can only jump when you deem it so. so you basically have a 33.33% chance of being the jumpmaster each game.

1771,"not good at math and looking for an answer abut a personality quizzhi, i am making a personality type quizz with some online program, that can only calculate a single final score.

&amp;#x200b;

the quizz consists of 8 questions with 3 statements each (a, b, c). when someone clicks one of the statements, he gets sorted into a small batch of three possible types. there are 9 types in total.

&amp;#x200b;

let's say he clicks statement 1a, he then gets sorted into to groups 9, 8 and 1. in other words: groups  9, 8 and 1 each get awarded 1 point, and the other groups get nothing. with each statement the groups are variable.

&amp;#x200b;

for example question 1 has the following types associated with it

&amp;#x200b;

1a 9.8.1

1b 5.3.1

1c 8.6.4

&amp;#x200b;

the batches of three are variable, so another question might look like this:

&amp;#x200b;

2a 9.5.4

2b 8.7.3

2c 6.2.1

&amp;#x200b;

now i have already figured out that i can represent the answer statements like this.

&amp;#x200b;

for example question 1

&amp;#x200b;

1a 9.8.1: 110000001

1b 5.3.1: 000010101

1c 8.6.4: 010101000

&amp;#x200b;

i will add to this 10 to the beginning, so when each question get ticked, this number will incrementally update with 1.

&amp;#x200b;

so i have the following series for question 1

&amp;#x200b;

10110000001

10000010101

10010101000

&amp;#x200b;

now my question is the following: i wanted to redirect users based on the score that they have, but i don't think that is possible with the the operators that are available to me. i can just say: when a certain number is greater or lesser than x, redirect the user to answer y.

&amp;#x200b;

since this is not possible, what i am looking  to redirect them based on an exact score. i can redirect like: when x is equal to y redirect to z.  in other words: i need a of list every combination of answers.

1815,"i have a weird question(s) having to do with the fibonacci sequencei was once in my friend's studio looking at a barrel. i got to thinking about fun ways to paint the barrel. i've always been fascinated with the fibonacci sequence and thought ""what if i painted the first slat, skipped the next, painted the next two, skipped the next three, etc."" 

i realized that in order to paint the whole barrel, i'd be doing quite a few second coats. from there, the question expanded. how many laps around a barrel of slat number n would it take to paint the whole barrel, following the rule paint, skip per corresponding fibonacci term? i took to the notepad, and things got hairy. 

if we let n denote number of barrel slats, ""turn"" denote how many times around the barrel until all painted, and ""fib"" the fibonacci term that finishes the barrel, you get (forgive formatting, am on mobile):

n=5; turn=3, fib=5
(paint slat a, skib b, paint c d, skip e a b, paint c d e a b &lt;--- all slats painted)

n=6; turn=2, fib=5
n=7; turn=4, fib=13
n=8; turn=3, fib=13
n=9; turn=3, fib=13
n=10; turn=3, fib=13

and so on until

n=14; turn=5, fib=34

excusing that this is just a curiosity, and probably a silly one at that, is there a more formal way to represent this? is there an extant investigation? which branch of mathematics should i go read about to get closer to understanding?

i think my original question was wondering whether there would ever be any n at which at least one slat would always be unpainted, but now i'm more curious as to whether there is any pattern or predictive formula to describe the relationship between n, turn, and fib.

1816,"how do i notate for ""all subsets of a power set whose cardinality is n""?i don't study maths, so please forgive my ignorance.

i want to write an equation that succinctly says ""y is a subset of [the set of (all possible subsets of x) with cardinality n]"".

so far, all i can write is

&gt; y ⊆ p(x)  
&gt; |y| = n, y ∈ y

and i can't think of a way to write it in one line.

i've tried to find different ways, but none seem to be right.

* y ⊆ p*_n_*(x)
* y ⊆ {p(x) | |p(x)| = n}
* y ⊆ x^n

---

update:

i've just discovered the concept is known as a ""*k*-combination"". i hope there is an easy notation for the set of all possible of such.

update 2:

i think i've found the answer from wikipedia. the set of all k-combinations of set x is notated: (*`x`_k_*). so i would write:

&gt; y ⊆ (*`x`_k_*)

i also found a more explicit formulation of the set on the interwebs as well:

1817,"trying to find ""cheat"" for drawing arcsi'm a carpenter, and we often have to scribe large diametre arcs to make arches (think arched doorways, spaceship bulkheads, whatever). usually we grab a stick and make a big compass, but sometimes it gets crowded in the shop, it's hard to set up and swing a 13' stick to get a tiny section of the circle.

this has been bugging me. i've seen the correct solution now, but i still don't understand why my solution did not work. my solution found 3 of the 4 answers but did not find all of them. can someone please help me understand why this approach did not fully work?

question: solve: 9\*tan(2x) - 18\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

here's what i did:

&amp;#x200b;

factor out a 9 and divide both sides by 9 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200b;

tan(2x) - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

replace tan(2x) with the double angle formula:

&amp;#x200b;

\[2\*tan(x) / 1 - tan\^2(x)\] - 2\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

multiply all terms by 1 - tan\^2(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200b;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x)\[1 - tan\^2(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200b;

distribute 2\*cos(x) to each term in the brackets:

&amp;#x200b;

2\*tan(x) - 2\*cos(x) + 2\*tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

factor out a 2 and divide both sides by 2 to get rid of it:

&amp;#x200b;

tan(x) - cos(x) + tan\^2(x)\*cos(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

replace all tan(x) with \[sin(x)/cos(x)\] and cancel one of the cos(x):

&amp;#x200b;

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos\^2(x)\]\*cos(x) = 0

\[sin(x)/cos(x)\] - cos(x) + \[sin\^2(x)/cos(x)\] = 0

&amp;#x200b;

multiply all terms by cos(x) to get rid of fractions:

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) - cos\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

&amp;#x200b;

replace cos\^2(x) with \[1-sin\^2(x)\] and simplify:

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) - \[1-sin\^2(x)\] + sin\^2(x) = 0

sin(x) - 1 + sin\^2(x) + sin\^2(x) = 0

2\*sin\^2(x) + sin(x) - 1 = 0

&amp;#x200b;

factor this as a quadratic equation:

&amp;#x200b;

(2\*sin(x) - 1\]\[sin(x) + 1\] = 0

&amp;#x200b;

set each factor = 0 and solve for x:

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) = 1/2

x = pi/6 or 5pi/6

&amp;#x200b;

sin(x) = -1

x = 3pi/2

&amp;#x200b;

1823,"formula with two unknown and four known variables : help solving for two unknownsgreetings to all.  this isn't a 'homework' problem; it's more of an issue that i've reached the limit of my imagination and can't find a solution.  a friend asked me for help, so i said i'd try.  this equation involves four known variables and two unknown variables, and i've been able to solve for any one variable, but not for two.  


this is a formula for calculating ratios of two substances of varying concentrations, expressed in milligrams per millilitre.  the goal is to come up with a mix of the two substances that together give a desired concentration and desired volume.    


the purpose of my question, is to get help devising an excel spreadsheet to do the calculations for the two unknowns, given the four known variables.  


the variables are:   
a: volume of substance one, in millilitres  
b: concentration of substance one, in milligrammes per ml  
c: volume of substance two, in ml  
d: concentration of substance two, in mg/ml  


x: total volume of substance one and substance two, in ml  
y: product concentration, in mg/ml  


the formulas are:   
( a \* b ) + ( c \* d ) = x \* y  
a + c = x  


wherein b and d, and x and y are defined by user input.  the concentrations of the two substances are known, as are the desired total volume and desired end concentration.  the values of a and c are the ones i'd like to be able to work out.  


i'm able to come up with formulae for solving for any one variable.  e.g.:   
a = ( c \* ( y - d ) ) / ( b - y )  


... but that's dependent upon another variable i'm trying to solve for, var c .  so i can't plug that into an excel spreadsheet because it can't crank out a value if there's an unknown in there.    


here's an example using known values:   
a = 1 ml  
b = 100 mg/ml  
c = 2 ml  
d = 25 mg/ml  
x = 3 ml  
y = 50 mg/ml  


therefore: ( 1 ml \* 100 mg\\ml ) + ( 2 ml \* 25 mg\\ml ) = 3 ml \* 50 mg\\ml   


i know that there's only one possible solution (no pun intended) for vars a and c, if given the concentrations of one and two, the desired concentration, and the desired volume.

here's a snapshot of the excel spreadsheet in progress: yellow fields are user input, grey fields are calculations, and orange fields are for calculated output.  at this point, i put values into the 'output' fields so the 'calculation' fields could have something to chew on.

1841,"levi civita on a geometric manifoldhi guys, i ran into a question while reading some stuff on differential geometry, and got confused by some posts online. i was hoping to find some help here.

&amp;#x200b;

consider the levi-civita tensor on a manifold, identified on the tangent plane locally. since we have the covariant and contravaraint forms of the tensor, i was curious about whether there were identities relating the levi-civita tensor (or a product of 2 of them) to the metric itself. further, i was also curious about taking local coordinate derivatives ($\\partial\_{x\_j} \\text{det}g$) of the determinant of the metric with the levi-civita tensor method.

&amp;#x200b;

 essentially, we could ignore the levi-civita symbol while taking partials through any of these operations, right?

more optimizable, instead of ((2\^4=16)!) transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits, the majority op on 3 bits to 1 bit, with all 8 choices of not vs identity, costs 2 bits to 4 choose 1 then costs 3 bits to not vs identity so costs only 32 possible unitary transforms and is still nphard since any nphard transform can be built of combos of majority op with optional nots, and there is no bias of specific values of the 3 bits read since all 8 not vs identity of them are used in 32 possible transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits. or if you dont trust this optimization you could stick with all the ((2\^4=16)!) possible transforms of 4 bits to 4 bits.

my question is, what is the complexity-class of reversing something derived from both the input and output of this unitary transform of n bits to n bits, such as the n input bits xor the n output bits? since its trivial to calculate forward or backward (but not both at once), i strongly suspect that reversing the xor of input and output is nphard and therefore proof that p!=np... but strongly suspecting is not proving. i'm not sure how to proceed in such a proof?

1866,"basic meal prep math question?hi! so i have a weird and probably super simple math question i'm tangoing with.

i'm making a big meal prep spread sheet, and i've crunched down the calories and macro-nutrients of a recipe using a ratio format, with the key ingredient being the primary factor "" 1:x:y:z "" . for example, i'll have a recipe based around 1lb of chicken with all other ingredients are in ratios relative to said 1lb of chicken to keep cooking / scaling simple for large, multiple person meal prepping. the issue i'm running into is finding an optimal way to make calorie-tight serving sizes. i find out how many servings of ""x"" calories i can make, but every way i've come up with to separate the remainder / leftover seems like it may be more complicated than it needs to be.

for example, i have one ""recipe / ratio"" which comes out to about 1826 calories, dividing into 3.652, five-hundred calorie portions. what i want to figure out is the easiest way to, in the real world, divide my 1826 calories of food into 3 even portions with the remainder of 0.652 of a meal. the unit of measurement of course will be weight, which i don't have at the moment (which should be able to be mathematically translated from the calories themselves).

my attempts and why they suck:

round up to the next # of portions. (so 3.65 rounds to 4). so if our recipe is 1826 calories, this makes four 456.5 cal servings. we know we want to end up with 3.65 total servings, so we take 0.35 of the fourth serving and distribute it among the original three. this isn't accurate as you have to distribute the 0.35 among the 3 full meals and the 0.65 of a meal itself. i know i'm missing some super elementary details to make this work but i can't figure out what exactly  and it makes me feel dumb lol.

the other thing i tried that does work is dividing all 1826 calories by 3 portions, leaving me with 608.66 calories per portion. from there i could remove the extra 108.66 calories, or 17.85% per serving. this actually works, (which i just figured this out as i was creating the post), but i was still wondering if there is more elegant math or an equation i can plug in that might tell me how to portion things out from the beginning.

tl;dr:

the idea is to cook the 1826 calories worth of food, weigh it, and then divide it into three 500 calorie portions with the 0.65 remaining off to the side in it's own mini portion for calorie tracking purposes. i have some ways to do so but i want to know if you smart folks have a more elegant solution.",0,basic meal prep math question hi  weird probably super simple math question i m tangoing with  i m making big meal prep spread sheet  i ve crunched calories macro nutrients recipe using ratio format  key ingredient primary factor     x y z     example  i ll recipe based around  lb chicken ingredients ratios relative said  lb chicken keep cooking   scaling simple large  multiple person meal prepping  issue i m running finding optimal way make calorie tight serving sizes  find many servings  x  calories make  every way i ve come separate remainder   leftover seems like may complicated needs be  example  one  recipe   ratio  comes   calories  dividing      five hundred calorie portions  want figure easiest way to  real world  divide   calories food   even portions remainder     meal  unit measurement course weight  moment  which able mathematically translated calories themselves  attempts suck  round next   portions   so     rounds    recipe   calories  makes four     cal servings  know want end     total servings  take     fourth serving distribute among original three  accurate distribute     among   full meals     meal itself  know i m missing super elementary details make work can t figure exactly makes feel dumb lol  thing tried work dividing   calories   portions  leaving     calories per portion  could remove extra     calories       per serving  actually works   which figured creating post  still wondering elegant math equation plug might tell portion things beginning  tl dr  idea cook   calories worth food  weigh it  divide three   calorie portions     remaining side mini portion calorie tracking purposes  ways want know smart folks elegant solution

1870,"formula for generating a tilted discbackground: i am building a 3d modeling solution that is bone first and model second. usually the model is made first and a skeleton for animation is created second. i'm exploring the wonderful world of procedural content and ran into an issue with my current solution. 

what i have now: i found a formula that uses radius, theta, and phi to get the x,y,z coordinate for a point on a sphere. it is...

    x = radius * sin phi * cos theta
    y = radius * sin phi * sin theta
    z = radius * cos phi

my theta and phi are based on the current iteration index multiplied by the number of radians i need per iteration to reach 2pi. the other is some constant fraction like pi/2 or 5pi/4. different combinations of 1 being constant and the other being iterative gives me a good variety of angles, but the issue is that the solution does not work for 3d rotations that are not aligned to at least 1 axis. i figure that is because of the constant value during iteration, but when i try to iterate both values i end up with something crazy. 

my goal: what i have now allows me to generate a disc tilted an arbitrary amount with a single iteration. i want to be able to create a disc of points and in that same iteration calculate their xyz for their final rotation. traditionally one would generate a disc facing y+ and then do rotation. or for a *modern* solution, generate the disc, parent the disc to a transform, and rotate the transform. i would like to avoid having to do something like that. 

some college friends suggested quaternions but i'm not sure how to use them on a set of points or on individual points as they're being generated. if there is some other solution or a way to get the solution i have now to work, i'd really like to know! thanks. 

a simple example, i would like to be able to create a ring if points the surface of which is perpendicular to the angle between the points (0,0,0) and (5, 10, 10).

--edit: a few more details that come to mind

i'm targeting webgl for the first build. i am not against doing this in multiple steps, i just care about performance. if creating a disc facing y+ and then using a rotation matrix to move all the points will be more performant than doing several sin/cos/etc calculations to get the final point in a single step i have no problem going with that. and since this is a math forum i wouldn't expect that concern to be taken into account and i would be happy to benchmark multiple solutions to see what works best!

--edit 2: i'm targeting webgl so i have threejs to make some boilerplate stuff simpler. i just found out that the geometry buffer class's lookat implementation applies a transform to its geometry instead of itself (like unity transform would). so i think i will be able to get away with generating a circle of points, setting them as the geometry data for the geometry buffer, using lookat to move the points, and then adding the tilted points to my target mesh. i will bench mark this against my current flawed solution to see how much overhead (?) this step adds. might also be worth checking the underlying implementation and using that directly so i don't have to construct a geometry buffer.

the actual outcome can either be a or b. it cannot be both a and b, and it cannot be neither a or b.

4 tests have been done, three have returned outcome a, and one has returned outcome b.

so that means the chance of 3 tests returning outcome a all being incorrect is 1% x 1% x 1% = 0.0001%, and the chance of the 1 test returning outcome b being incorrect is 1%.

1. 25% major projects average
1. 10% class participation
1. *10% dropped category*

**100% final average** (not a category)

now, what complicates matters is that one of the categories was for an assignment the instructor dropped, due to lack of time. so the other 90% need to be ""redistributed"" to become the whole 100% of what we will be graded on. i am not sure how to do that.

i'm doing numerics and i'm simulating a simple linear pendulum with eulers method.

i understand that the convergence of euler is 1, meaning that by halving the stepsize dt, the accumulated error at a certain time should halve as well.

i simulated the pendulum for one period and then examined the accumulated error for different dt. in my calculations, the convergence rate is much higher than 1, actually roughly 2.2. is that normal? is the convergence rate just a lower bound? (i also tried it with half a period and 100 periods)

i'm really confused by this. i also implemented runge kutta methods, and with them the convergence rate comes out precisely as expected.

edit: here is a plot of the residual against the used time step

 figured it out. when running the system only for a quarter period t/4 and compare the numerical solution to the analytical result, i recover the convergence rate of 1 for the euler.

1944,"probability questionhey, everyone! i've been trying to find a fair way to balance rolling for stats in d&amp;d.   
how i went about this is assuming the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) is the most balanced. that means an average of 12 and a combined total of 72. i originally went about it like this:   
72=6(x((y+1)/2)) or 24=x(y+1), where x=number of dice rolled and y=maximum possible roll.  
this originally didn't work since i wanted both x to be a positive integer and y to be an even integer. i fixed the problem by assuming you re-roll all 1s, making the new minimum 2:  
24=x(y+2)  
i plotted this function and found some really good settings that worked.   
x|y  
2|10  
3|6  
4|4  
the table means the players are offered a choice of rollings 2d10s, 3d6s, or 4d4s. on all of these rolls, players will re-roll all 1s.   
the problem i've encountered with my players is so far, the 3 players that have already rolled for stats have achieved totals above 72. all of them chose to roll 3d6s, re-rolling all ones.   


my question: are these actually fair ways to roll dice assuming a fair average is 12? is there something i'm not accounting for  that might change the average? if it is a fair way, how can i reduce the the variance in stat totals my players get?   
(as a heads-up, my guess is i did not account for standard deviation and i still would not know how to account for standard deviation in a probability question.)

**fixed values available**:

  


\-my goal 'cost per sale aquisition' (cpa) - how much i can spend in marketing before i need to see a sale.

\-the number of agents i have

\-the numbers of hours they work new leads a day, and days they work a month.

\-the per agent sales goal amount

\-the average amount of time per connected call.

  


**sliding factors** (i have these internal metrics, but don't know how the optimal way to combine them to achieve the best buying strategy):

  


\-the contact rate i get at each 'bid' price level (how likely it is the 'lead' answers the phone, grouped by dollar amount) 

\-the conversion to sale rate at each bid price level

  


i realize this is complex, but i have feel like i have all the metrics here to put together an equation. example of the numbers below:

  


\-monthly goal cpa: $500 (cpa= total cost/number of sales) 

\-number of agents: 10

\-sales goal per agent: 20 per month

\-days worked per month: 22

\-average time working new leads per day: 4 hours

\-average call time per connected call: 10 minutes.

  


\-connected rate (lead to connected call numbers): 

 \-marketing partner 1: $7-20%, $10-35%, $20-45%

 \-marketing partner 2: $8-25%, $12-37%, $24-48%

 \-marketing partner 3: $15 - 50%, $25 - 65%, $40 - 75%

  


\-conversion rate (lead to sale):
